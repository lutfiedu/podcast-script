Abstract: This study investigates the factors influencing undergraduate students’ self-directed learning (SDL) abilities in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven interactive learning environments.
The advent of generative AI has revolutionized interactive learning environments, offering unprecedented opportunities for personalized and adaptive education. Generative AI supports teachers
in delivering smart education, enhancing students’ acceptance of technology, and providing personalized, adaptive learning experiences. Nevertheless, the application of generative AI in higher
education is underexplored. This study explores how these AI-driven platforms impact undergraduate students’ self-directed learning (SDL) abilities, focusing on the key factors of teacher support,
learning strategies, and technology acceptance. Through a quantitative approach involving surveys
of 306 undergraduates, we identified the key factors of motivation, technological familiarity, and the
quality of AI interaction. The findings reveal the mediating roles of self-efficacy and learning motivation. Also, the findings confirmed that improvements in teacher support and learning strategies
within generative AI-enhanced learning environments contribute to increasing students’ self-efficacy,
technology acceptance, and learning motivation. This study contributes to uncovering the influencing
factors that can inform the design of more effective educational technologies and strategies to enhance
student autonomy and learning outcomes. Our theoretical model and research findings deepen the
understanding of applying generative AI in higher education while offering important research
contributions and managerial implications.

1. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around for a considerable time, offering significant potential for personalized education to cater to learners’ differences and needs [1].
Generative AI, a field based on machine learning, particularly deep learning, has recently
gained substantial attention. The advent of generative AI has revolutionized interactive
learning environments, offering unprecedented opportunities for personalized and adaptive education. Generative AI refers to machine learning models that can create new
content, including text, images, and even personalized learning pathways [2]. Generative
AI possesses powerful capabilities to autonomously create novel and meaningful content,
employing various methods to produce high-quality text, images, audio, and other media
formats [3]. These technologies have shown the potential to adapt to individual learner

needs, providing immediate feedback and facilitating interactive learning experiences.
They have profoundly impacted educational research and practice, driving educational
innovations and transforming traditional teaching methods and learning strategies.
Generative AI and AI–human collaboration have facilitated the development of conversational AI based on natural language processing, achieving breakthroughs in information
retrieval, knowledge representation, content creation, and knowledge reasoning [4].
Recent studies have shown that students benefit significantly from the prompts provided by generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Bing Chat, demonstrating a degree of
critical thinking when utilizing this technology [5,6]. Diwan et al. found that AI-based
learning content generation and learning pathway augmentation contribute to improving
learner engagement. The research by Li et al. highlighted the tremendous potential of
ChatGPT in promoting self-directed language learning (SDLL), offering new insights into
learning technology innovation and AI-assisted self-directed learning (SDL) research [7,8].
Additionally, experimental studies have indicated that students exhibit higher intrinsic
motivation, improved learning performance, and positive attitudes in GenAI-supported
scenarios [9]. Lu et al. found that pre-service teachers who used generative AI scored
higher in teacher self-efficacy and higher-order thinking in both the experimental and
control groups [10]. These findings imply that generative AI, such as ChatGPT, offers numerous advantages in educational settings. It provides students with personalized learning
experiences, enhances learning efficiency, and supports teachers’ professional development [10]. Despite generative AI’s novel capabilities in improving education quality, the
human element remains irreplaceable. Nevertheless, existing studies ignore the mechanism
of self-directed learning (SDL) when students apply generative AI. SDL is a process in
which individuals take the initiative to diagnose their learning needs, formulate goals,
identify resources, and evaluate outcomes [11]. Previous SDL research has highlighted
the importance of motivation, resource availability, and institutional support in fostering
SDL [12], but it remained unclear in classrooms augmented by AI. While this theoretical
puzzle is of great interest for academic research, it is also of great educational value and
managerial relevance, because quality education is recognized as important United Nation
sustainable development goals [13].
To address this knowledge gap, this study embraces the Generative Learning Theory
as the theoretical lens to explore the mechanisms and interactions underlying self-directed
learning in generative AI-supported interactive environments [14]. It seeks to measure
changes in students’ self-directed learning abilities and investigate future pathways for
smart education practice. This research could facilitate the effective integration of generative
AI in teaching, helping educators provide personalized instruction to students. Based on
the above, we propose two research questions below:

•
•

RQ1: How does generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) support self-directed learning?
RQ2: What factors influence students’ self-directed learning abilities in generative
AI-driven interactive environments?

We meticulously developed a questionnaire grounded in established self-regulated
learning scales pertinent to AI–human interaction, incorporating critical dimensions such
as goal setting and time management [15,16]. To ensure its suitability for a generative AI
learning environment, we carefully refined the dimension descriptions and introduced
additional items. Following a rigorous expert evaluation and a comprehensive pilot study,
the questionnaire demonstrated robust reliability. A subsequent survey of 306 undergraduate students revealed that technological familiarity and learning motivation significantly
impact self-directed learning capabilities, with self-efficacy, learning strategies, and teacher
support functioning as mediating variables.
Venturing into the research insights of future education generative AI, this study made
three contributions. As a theoretical contribution, this study presents a conceptual model
that encompasses critical factors explaining generative AI and self-directed learning. We
uncovered the human elements of self-efficacy, autonomous learning ability, and learning

Systems 2024, 12, 332

motivation in this mechanism. The theoretical insights from this study contribute to extending the Generative Learning Theory to thrive in a world of constant technological changes.
Secondly, our study provided key implications to educators for tomorrow, where technological advancements and new pedagogical theories continually reshape the landscape.
We argue that teacher support and technology acceptance are critical for adapting to the
shifting demands of their profession and the diverse needs of their students. Thirdly, our
research findings provide important managerial implications for policymakers in education.
The future of education is not about choosing to use AI or abandon AI, but it is about
fostering a catalyst for a lifelong passion for self-direct learning facilitated by AI.
2. Literature Review
2.1. Mechanisms of Generative AI Facilitating Generative Learning
The Generative Learning Theory posits that learning is an active process [14]. The
generative model theorizes research insights in educational psychology, viewing learning
as a constructive cognitive process and considering human cognitive learning, abilities,
and attitudes [14]. The Generative Learning Theory posits that learners actively engage
in generating, organizing, and integrating information to construct knowledge. Learners
must not solely rely on the passive reception of external information. They should generate
representations such as diagrams, images, tables, or charts based on their existing cognitive
structures and sensory information from the environment. They autonomously create
learning activities to deepen their understanding, actively interpreting and making meaning
of the information.
Following this theoretical lens, Fiorella and Mayer further argued that generative
learning activities involve learners’ active engagement to deepen their understanding of the
course material. The key principles of this theory include encouraging active participation
through creation, hypothesis, and experimentation; integrating new content with existing
cognitive structures; and promoting diverse learning strategies such as summarizing,
organizing, connecting, and drawing as generative learning strategies.
Moser and Lewalter highlighted the alignment between the Generative Learning
Theory and Constructivist Theory, asserting that learning involves comparison, adjustment,
and reorganization to construct new concepts and knowledge [17]. For instance, learners
need to adopt heuristic and exploratory approaches when solving problems and acquiring
knowledge, positively impacting their ability to tackle mathematical challenges [18]. This
involves observing and analyzing problem patterns, seeking regularities, and applying
these patterns to new contexts [19]. Continuous reflection and metacognition are necessary
for optimizing learning processes and strategies to improve performance [20]. In addition,
ongoing sharing and interaction facilitate knowledge construction and sharing [21].
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its generalization, transfer, and creative
capabilities, can drive the reconstruction of existing concepts and the construction of new
cognition. Additionally, it enhances heuristic and exploratory learning while promoting reflective learning. Through sustained interaction with learners, AI also transforms
metacognitive approaches (Figure 1).
2.2. Promoting Cognitive Construction and Conceptual Reconstruction
The generative learning process aligns with the Cognitive Constructivist Theory,
emphasizing learners’ active generation and reconstruction of knowledge to understand
and solve problems. In this process, students actively explore, process, and integrate
information, thereby fostering the construction and reconstruction of personal knowledge
structures, leading to deeper learning and comprehension [22]. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) leverages generative models to accumulate parameters for sequential tasks
and supports iterative learning and optimization. This enables the AI to adapt to new data
through continuous learning, rapidly updating knowledge and integrating cross-domain
information. By continually generating, comparing, and reconstructing, generative AI
enhances its transferability and generalization capabilities, akin to knowledge integration

and cognitive enhancement processes [23]. Generative AI, using models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), can generate text and images while revealing hidden
structures in complex data distributions, offering new approaches to solving problems in
cognitive science and potentially aiding cognitive science research [24].

Systems 2024, 12, 332

generative AI, students can take control of their learning, set personal learning goals, direct
their learning paths, evaluate their progress, and reflect on their learning processes.
Research shows that generative AI significantly enhances learning efficacy, motivation,
and knowledge construction by providing personalized learning content and interactive experiences [29]. Additionally, it fosters changes in teaching models and strategies, effectively
stimulating learning interest, increasing student engagement, and improving learning
outcomes [30]. Teacher support is crucial, as it provides the emotional, cognitive, and
behavioral support needed to stimulate students’ interest and motivation [31]. Therefore,
generative learning within generative AI-driven interactive learning environments can be
seen as a new learning system influenced by the key factors of teacher support, students’
technological acceptance, and self-directed learning strategies.
3.1. Enhancing Teacher Support Capabilities with Generative AI
Teachers are pivotal in steering students to employ AI as an impetus for their learning
capacities. Teacher support is a crucial factor influencing learning abilities, directly and significantly positively affecting students’ academic adaptation, engagement, and satisfaction.
The integration of teacher support and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be categorized into
two approaches: AI-supported Teacher and Teacher-supported AI. The former focuses on
how AI technologies can enhance teaching effectiveness, improve instructional efficiency,
and offer better-differentiated instruction for teachers [32]. The latter concentrates on
how students can utilize AI’s data retrieval capabilities under teacher guidance to obtain
personalized learning experiences, precise learning resources, and effective instructional
guidance [33]. In the context of smart classroom teaching, generative AI can assist teachers
in optimizing instructional strategies and curriculum design [34]. In intelligent content
generation, it helps tailor teaching materials to meet specific educational goals and student
needs [35]. Furthermore, in intelligent educational data analysis, generative AI enables
teachers to better understand student behavior patterns and provide tailored teaching
methods [36].
The integration of generative AI in enhancing teacher support capabilities is broadreaching. For example, within the dialogic learning model, AI-enabled intelligent inquiry
fosters the development of higher-order thinking and questioning skills, thereby deepening
knowledge mastery and enhancing cognitive abilities [37]. Additionally, generative AI
assists teachers in discerning variations in students’ knowledge acquisition, interaction
patterns, and depth in programming learning support, subsequently influencing learning
outcomes. Teacher support encompasses not only the transmission of knowledge but also
provides psychological, emotional, and behavioral support [38].
Generative AI enables the real-time analysis of student learning, metacognition, and
behavior, supporting teachers in guiding students. Leveraging large language models and
multimodal technologies, AI can generate diverse learning resources such as text, images,
audio, and video. It can also understand the mental health of individual students and
groups, thereby providing comprehensive cognitive, emotional, and behavioral assessments and diagnostic support. Investing in teacher support not only refines their teaching
practices but also embodies AI with effective learning strategies for their students. In
summary, this study proposes the following hypotheses:
H1. In generative AI-driven interactive learning environments, teacher support can directly
influence students’ learning strategies.
H2. In generative AI-driven interactive learning environments, teacher support can directly
influence students’ learning motivation.
3.2. Ensuring Adequate Technology Acceptance for Generative AI
Generative AI requires users to possess specific competencies, as it provides information to support problem-solving and retrieves and generates multimodal data resources.

Systems 2024, 12, 332

6 of 19

However, overreliance on technology without critical thinking can detrimentally affect
students’ learning. Due to the inherent limitations of training on incomplete or biased
data, generative AI can sometimes produce erroneous or nonsensical information, known
as the hallucination effect, which necessitates discernment and judgment from users. For
instance, while generative AI can propose adaptive instructional content and strategies,
the effectiveness may fall short of standards [39]. It can offer suggestions for classroom
management and learning assessment, but the content is often based on preset prompts
and may not meet the specific needs of teachers [40]. Furthermore, while generative AI can
analyze student assignments and provide dialogic feedback, these interactions may lack
explanatory depth and occasionally exhibit flawed logical reasoning [41].
The hallucination effect of generative AI can lead to misinterpretations among both
teachers and students, prompting some schools and teachers to approach its integration
into teaching environments cautiously. Studies using the Technology Acceptance Model
(TAM) have examined the behavioral intentions of teachers and students regarding the
adoption of AI technologies. The TAM consists of perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived
ease of use (PEOU) [42]. PU refers to the recognition of AI technology’s benefits in learning,
while PEOU focuses on the convenience of operating and interacting with the technology.
Through the TAM, deeper insights into the levels of acceptance of AI technology in education can be gained, enabling the proposal of suitable training and support measures to
enhance understanding and ensure correct application.
Despite these challenges, the perceived ease of using generative AI remains a key factor
driving its widespread adoption. Its natural language processing capabilities enhance userfriendliness and multifunctionality, making it a widely used educational tool, which few AI
technologies have achieved before. However, accessibility and ease of use do not necessarily
translate into effective and meaningful use, especially in learning and teaching contexts.
The perceived usefulness of generative AI, like other digital tools, relies on proficient use,
particularly the flexible application of Prompt Engineering. In the realm of large language
models, prompts are articulated as natural language sentences or fragments, including
descriptions, commands, inquiries, and requests, that trigger the generative AI’s responses
based on patterns learned during training. The perceived usefulness of generative AI
largely depends on the quality of the prompts it receives; when integrated with subject
knowledge and critical thinking, it can potentially enhance learning engagement.
Therefore, this study proposes the following hypothesis:
H3. The level of acceptance of generative AI technology can directly influence students’ self-directed
learning abilities.
3.3. Adapting Self-Directed Learning Strategies through Generative AI
Generative AI supports students in transitioning their cognitive processes to select
learning information from AI-generated content and integrate it with existing knowledge.
This aligns with generative learning strategies that emphasize selecting, organizing, and
integrating learning content [43]. For instance, generative AI can facilitate self-paced learning, personalized learning paths, and immersive experiences, boosting learning motivation
and engagement [44]. It can also increase willingness to communicate in specific languages
through chat interactions, maintaining dialogue and generating personalized language
learning materials [45]. Additionally, AI offers feedback and personalized learning support
and assessment roles, either as a peer or mentor [46]. It can effectively enhance students’
problem-solving abilities and learning satisfaction through online cooperative learning
models [47].
Generative AI supports learners by enabling goal-setting, retrieving and creating multimodal learning resources, generating adaptive learning plans, and providing continuous
feedback and evaluation, driving adjustments to their existing learning strategies. Unlike
traditional self-directed learning (SDL), which often lacks real-time support and interaction
from teachers and peers, AI facilitates ongoing collaboration with teachers and peers. This

Systems 2024, 12, 332

7 of 19

transformation enables learners to engage in higher levels of human–AI collaboration,
transforming their self-management, problem-solving, and continuous learning methods
by actively interacting with AI to generate personalized learning plans, resources, feedback,
and assessments.
As a new form of AI application, generative AI possesses uncertainties and developmental stages. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), based on the Theory of Reasoned
Action, analyzes users’ attitudes and behavioral intentions toward technology, serving as
a direct factor for teachers and students to determine the use of AI-assisted teaching and
learning. Perceived usefulness gauges the likelihood of enhancing performance through
generative AI in teaching and autonomous learning. Simultaneously, when perceived ease
of use indicates simplicity and learnability, it fosters positive attitudes towards using AI as
a teaching and learning tool, bolstering autonomous learning intentions among students.
This underscores the direct positive impact of perceived ease of use on students’ willingness
for autonomous learning. In line with this, we propose:
H4. Learning strategies supported by generative AI can indirectly influence self-directed learning
ability through the mediating effect of technology acceptance.
3.4. Boosting Learning Motivation and Self-Efficacy with Generative AI
In generative learning, self-efficacy pertains to individuals’ self-assessment of their
learning capabilities and behaviors. It represents students’ self-perception and assessment
of their capability to accomplish learning tasks [48]. Research underscores that learning
motivation and self-efficacy remain critical factors within AI educational environments
and interact with factors such as technology acceptance and learning strategies [49]. For
instance, in AI programming learning, self-efficacy, AI literacy, and course satisfaction
directly influence learning interest and willingness [50]. Generative AI teaching platforms
enhance students’ perceived interaction with AI during writing skill training, demonstrating a strong connection between interaction strategies, self-efficacy, and learning
experience [51]. AI-assisted foreign language teaching significantly boosts student engagement, promoting learning motivation and self-directed learning through personalized
learning experiences [52].
Generative AI offers timely feedback and adjusts problem difficulty, offering swift
responses to help students gauge their learning status, recognize their strengths and weaknesses, and feel more confident in mastering knowledge. Simultaneously, the problems
generated by generative AI maintain an appropriate level of difficulty, motivating students
to sustain their interest in learning and progressively enhance their skills. The flexibility to
arrange learning schedules according to an individual’s pace fosters the habit and ability
of self-directed learning while reducing anxiety, allowing learners to study in a more relaxed state. Overall, generative AI aids in enhancing students’ learning motivation and
self-efficacy by offering personalized learning experiences, timely feedback, challenging
yet manageable tasks, and adaptive learning paths. Considering the above, we propose:
H5. In generative AI-driven interactive learning environments, students’ learning motivation can
directly influence their self-directed learning ability.
H6. In generative AI-driven interactive learning environments, learning strategies can indirectly
influence learning motivation through the mediation of self-efficacy.
H7. In generative AI-driven interactive learning environments, self-efficacy can indirectly influence
self-directed learning ability through the mediating impact of learning motivation.

Among the 306 valid samples, the distribution was as follows: 25% freshmen (77 students),
24% sophomores (73 students), 26% juniors (80 students), and 25% seniors (76 students).
Participants spanned various academic fields, including humanities (e.g., linguistics and history), sciences (e.g., physics and chemistry), and arts (e.g., visual arts and music). The gender distribution was balanced, with 48% male (147 students) and 52% female (159 students).
In terms of technological background, 39% (120 students) were from technology-related
majors such as computer science, educational technology, and information technology,
while 61% (186 students) were from non-technology majors, including literature, arts,
and education. This diverse sample composition ensured comprehensive applicability
and representativeness of the research findings, aligning with the characteristics of the
contemporary undergraduate demographic. Of the 306 participants, 39% were enrolled
in technology-related majors, and the gender distribution was nearly equal, accurately
reflecting the characteristics of the contemporary undergraduate demographic.
4.2. Instrument
This study utilized a 37-item survey questionnaire, focusing on assessing factors such
as students’ technology acceptance, self-efficacy, learning strategies, learning motivation,
and teacher support concerning students’ self-regulated learning abilities, particularly
within generative AI-driven interactive learning environments. The survey was divided
into two parts. The first part collected demographic information about the participants,
such as gender, age, and academic background. The second part comprised the main
questionnaire, which included six key constructs: self-efficacy, learning strategies, learning
motivation, technology acceptance, teacher support, and self-regulated learning ability. The
questionnaire’s dimensions and items were adapted from existing self-regulated learning
scales relevant to AI–human interaction [15,16]. These scales were appropriately modified
to fit the characteristics of generative AI-driven interactive learning environments.
4.3. Data Analysis
In this study, we employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) as a comprehensive
analytical approach to thoroughly evaluate and validate the theoretical model. SEM
integrates the principles of factor analysis and regression analysis, excelling in uncovering
complex causal relationships and interactions among multiple variables. Adhering strictly
to the classical two-step procedure proposed by Bagozzi and Yi [53], we utilized AMOS
26 for data processing and analysis.
At the outset of the research, we conducted rigorous reliability and validity tests
using SPSS 26.0 to ensure the robustness and accuracy of our findings. To perform a
reliability analysis, we calculated Cronbach’s α coefficients for each variable. As shown
in Table 1, all six latent variables exhibited Cronbach’s α values exceeding the commonly
accepted threshold of 0.7 [54], with values ranging from 0.714 to 0.891, indicating high
measurement reliability. The calculation of Composite Reliability (CR) also supported the
internal consistency of the model, with each latent variable showing CR values above the
0.7 standard, demonstrating excellent convergent validity [55]. Additionally, the Average
Variance Extracted (AVE) values were all above the 0.5 threshold, indicating good scale
validity [55]. As illustrated in Table 1, each construct’s CR exceeded 0.7, and each construct’s
AVE was greater than 0.5. The results of this study reveal the outstanding convergent
validity of the scale, further corroborating the strong and substantial intrinsic correlations
among the latent variables.
Subsequently, we conducted a thorough assessment of the measurement model to
ensure data reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent in-depth analysis. Descriptive statistics and correlation analyses
were performed using SPSS 26.0 software(Version: 28.0.0.0 (190)) to examine the relationships among the variables. The results indicated that the mean scores of all constructs on a

1 to 5 rating scale were above 1.9. Additionally, significant positive correlations were found
between self-regulated learning ability and learning motivation, self-efficacy, learning
strategies, teacher support, and technology acceptance. These findings laid the foundation
for the further exploration of mediating effects.

Thereafter, we conducted linear regression analysis to test specific hypotheses and
determine the direct impact of independent variables on the dependent variable. This
analysis helped identify the factors influencing students’ self-regulated learning ability. To
ensure the robustness of the model, we calculated multicollinearity statistics, including
Tolerance and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), to detect potential multicollinearity issues
among the predictor variables. Following this, we rigorously tested the structural model to
confirm the accuracy of model fit and structural validity.
Finally, using AMOS 26 software (Version: 28.0.0.0 (190)) and the maximum likelihood
estimation method, we systematically tested the seven core hypotheses of the study. We
utilized Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the complex relationships among
the variables. SEM allows for the simultaneous estimation of direct and indirect effects.
AMOS 26 was chosen for its exceptional reliability and robust analytical capabilities, making
it the ideal tool for this complex analysis task. Through these rigorous procedures and
scientific analyses, we provided strong empirical support for the evaluation and validation
of the theoretical model.
5. Results
5.1. Descriptive Statistics and Correlation Analysis
The means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients between the variables are
presented in Table 2. The results, calculated using SPSS, indicate that, within the 1 to 5 rating
scale, the mean values for all the constructs are above 1.9, ranging from 1.922 (self-efficacy;
SD = 0.9712) to 2.277 (learning strategies; SD = 1.1389). There are significant positive correlations between self-directed learning ability and learning motivation, self-efficacy, learning
strategies, teacher support, and technology acceptance. These relationships provide a
necessary foundation for the further exploration of mediating effects.

5.2. Linear Regression Analysis
A regression analysis was conducted to examine the factors influencing students’ selfregulated learning ability, as shown in Table 3. Controlling for related variables, significant
positive relationships were found between self-regulated learning ability and learning
motivation (b = 0.233, p < 0.001), learning strategies (b = 0.123, p < 0.01), and technology
acceptance (b = 0.328, p < 0.001). Additionally, technology acceptance was significantly
positively related to self-efficacy (b = 0.178, p < 0.01), learning strategies (b = 0.147, p < 0.01),
and teacher support (b = 0.188, p < 0.001). Learning motivation also had significant
positive relationships with self-efficacy (b = 0.355, p < 0.001) and teacher support (b = 0.253,
p < 0.001). Similarly, both self-efficacy and teacher support were significantly positively
related to learning strategies and learning motivation.

The tolerance values for the regression model of the factors influencing self-regulated
learning ability ranged from 0.536 to 0.730, and all VIF values were below the criterion
of 5, indicating that there was no multicollinearity issue among the predictor variables
in the regression equation. Next, the PROCESS macro will be utilized to further examine
the multiple mediation effects and explore the relationships between the variables. Linear
regression analysis showed that learning motivation had a significant positive effect on
self-regulated learning ability (b = 0.233, p < 0.001), supporting hypothesis H5. Technology
acceptance had a significant positive effect on self-regulated learning ability (b = 0.328,
p < 0.001), supporting hypothesis H3.
5.3. Assessment of Direct, Indirect, and Total Effects
Table 4 details the seven interaction pathways among factors such as technology acceptance, learning strategies, and self-regulated learning ability within generative AI-driven
interactive learning environments. By analyzing the path coefficients and critical ratios,
it is shown that, for instance, the path coefficient for teacher support to learning strategies is 0.594 and, for teacher support to learning motivation, is 0.36, with C.R. > 1.96 and
p ≤ 0.001. This indicates that teacher support can significantly and positively influence
both learning strategies and learning motivation directly, confirming hypotheses H1 and
H2. Similarly, the same pattern applies to paths such as “technology acceptance → selfregulated learning ability” and “learning motivation → self-regulated learning ability”,
confirming hypotheses H3 and H5. These results reveal the deep-seated intrinsic relationships between factors within generative AI-driven interactive learning environments,
providing essential theoretical support for understanding and optimizing the application
of generative AI.

indicating the range within which the true indirect effect is expected to fall 95% of the time.

H4. Path 2 shows that learning strategies in generative AI-driven interactive learning
environments can significantly positively influence self-regulated learning ability through
the mediating effect of self-efficacy, supporting hypothesis H6. Path 3 indicates that
self-efficacy in generative AI-driven interactive learning environments can significantly
positively influence self-regulated learning ability through the mediating effect of learning
motivation, supporting hypothesis H7.
Based on the integration of numerous pathways and data analyses, we have found
that teacher support not only directly facilitates the improvement of learning strategies and
learning motivation but also indirectly enhances students’ self-efficacy and self-regulated
learning ability. Learning strategies directly influence technology acceptance and selfefficacy and indirectly affect self-regulated learning ability and learning motivation. The
extent of students’ acceptance of technology and the strength of their learning motivation
can directly influence their self-regulated learning ability. The interaction among factors
such as learning motivation, self-regulated learning ability, and learning strategies collectively constructs a complex network that influences students’ self-regulated learning ability.
In the application of educational technology and classroom teaching practices, a profound
understanding of these interrelationships is crucial for establishing effective educational
interventions and optimizing learning environments.
6. Discussion
The findings highlight the critical role of motivation, technological familiarity, and the
quality of AI interactions in fostering SDL among undergraduate students. These insights
suggest that educational institutions should focus on enhancing these factors to optimize
the effectiveness of AI-driven learning environments. Building upon our research model
(Figure 3), this study extends the exploration of factors influencing students’ self-directed
learning ability within generative AI-driven interactive learning environments. The findings validate the expanded model’s efficacy in explaining the determinants of university
students’ self-directed learning capabilities in such environments. Among the various factors examined, hypothesis H3 (technology acceptance) demonstrated the most significant
direct effect on self-directed learning ability (β = 0.58, p < 0.001). The literature consistently
identified technology acceptance as a pivotal factor in enhancing self-regulated and selfdirected learning capacities [56]. Schiavo et al. and Chiu et al. further illustrated that AI
literacy and acceptance significantly bolster learning outcomes and self-efficacy [57,58]. In
contrast, hypothesis H5 (learning motivation) also showed a positive influence, albeit with
a smaller path coefficient (β = 0.33, p < 0.001). The enhancement of motivation not only
cultivates a positive disposition towards technology among students, prompting them to
engage more proactively with AI tools for learning, but also strengthens their self-directed

Systems 2024, 12, 332

learning capabilities through active participation and interaction [59]. The personalized
and dynamically adaptive learning experiences facilitated by generative AI allow highly
motivated students to more effectively harness these resources for autonomous learning.
Moreover, motivation functions as a mediating factor between technology acceptance
and learning outcomes, thereby indirectly augmenting students’ self-directed learning
abilities [60]. These results indicate that technology acceptance has a greater impact on
self-directed learning ability than learning motivation. This suggests that, in generative
AI-driven interactive learning environments, the degree of technology acceptance is the
primary factor affecting students’ self-directed learning ability.
Additionally, H4 indicates that learning strategies indirectly influence self-directed
learning ability through the mediating role of technology acceptance. This implies that
effective learning strategies can enhance students’ acceptance of technology, making them
perceive the use of technology in generative AI-driven interactive learning environments
as beneficial for improving their learning efficiency and outcomes [61]. When students
recognize that learning strategies facilitate technology acceptance, they are more likely
to proactively explore and apply various technological resources to support their learning, ultimately fostering their self-directed learning ability and lifelong learning mindset.
Enhancing technology acceptance through learning strategies is relatively complex and
requires collaborative efforts from both educators and students. Setting clear learning goals,
cultivating learning interest, adopting effective learning methods, actively promoting and
demonstrating technology applications, and providing personalized technical support and
guidance can help students better understand and utilize technological tools. This, in turn,
improves their technology acceptance and enhances their self-directed learning ability.
H7 posits that self-efficacy indirectly influences self-directed learning ability through
the mediating role of learning motivation. Individuals with high self-efficacy are more
likely to believe in their capability to complete learning tasks, thereby exhibiting stronger
learning motivation [62]. Learning motivation serves as the intrinsic drive that propels
students to engage in learning activities. Highly motivated students are more inclined
to explore learning methods and strategies actively, manage their learning process, and
evaluate and adjust their learning outcomes, as suggested by Lo et al. [63]. These behaviors
are critical components of self-directed learning ability.
In the Structural Equation Model of this study, H1 reveals that teacher support has
the most significant and substantial impact on learning strategies among all the constructs
(β = 0.59, p < 0.001). This finding indicates that, with teacher support, students are more
likely to develop and effectively apply learning strategies. Generally, with encouragement
and guidance from teachers, students feel more confident in facing learning challenges,
which leads them to experiment with new learning methods and strategies. This aligns
with the perspective of Hoferichter et al. [64]. H2 shows that teacher support significantly
affects learning motivation (β = 0.36, p < 0.001), suggesting that students feel valued and
recognized under teacher support, providing the drive for continuous improvement and
greatly enhancing learning motivation. This finding is consistent with previous conclusions
by scholars [65]. These hypotheses indicate that, when students receive teacher support,
their learning environment and psychological state significantly improve, promoting the
use of learning strategies and enhancing learning motivation. Furthermore, H6 posits that
learning strategies indirectly influence learning motivation through the mediating role of
self-efficacy. The research substantiates this hypothesis by demonstrating that the proficient
deployment of self-regulated learning strategies is pivotal for attaining educational objectives. Furthermore, self-efficacy is identified as a fundamental prerequisite for the successful
implementation of these strategies [66]. Improved learning strategies enhance students’
learning efficiency and performance, subsequently boosting their self-efficacy. Through
cognitive and affective effects, this indirectly increases students’ learning motivation.

7. Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Research
This study underscores the potential of generative AI to support SDL in higher education. We endeavor to make three contributions to the literature. As a theoretical contribution,
we apply the Generative Learning Theory to AI, and education involves leveraging AI
technologies to enhance active learning processes and foster deeper understanding among
students. This study sheds new light on generative AI in education studies by presenting a
conceptual model. This study, through the Structural Equation Modeling method, elucidates the interplay among different factors within generative AI-driven interactive learning
environments and how generative AI directly or indirectly influences self-regulated learning ability through self-efficacy, learning motivation, and technology acceptance models.
Our findings argue to use AI technologies to empower students as active participants in
their self-learning processes, promoting deeper understanding, personalization, reflection,
and collaboration in educational settings. Firstly, teacher support, as a significant external
factor, can transform students’ learning strategies and enhance their learning motivation.
Therefore, there is a need to promptly revise the existing teaching concepts and methods to
keep pace with the era of AI education. Secondly, the capacity for technology acceptance is
a critical factor in enhancing self-regulated learning ability within generative AI-driven
interactive learning environments, posing new requirements and challenges for students’
technological awareness and digital literacy. Additionally, the enhancement of learning
strategy levels by generative AI warrants in-depth analysis, especially as AI has altered
the existing methods of information processing, selective focus, learning assistance, and
self-testing. Finally, this Structural Equation Model reaffirms the validity of self-efficacy
theory, self-determination theory, and achievement motivation theory, underscoring the
ongoing need to strengthen students’ intrinsic motivation to enhance self-regulated learning ability, regardless of technological advancements. By addressing the key influencing
factors, educators and technologists can design more effective learning environments that
empower students to take charge of their learning journeys.
As a practical contribution, this paper proposes the following practical pathways for
relevant generative learning models:
(1)

Cultivating Artificial Intelligence digital literacy: strengthening intrinsic motivation

The current wave of digitization and automation is driving educational transformation,
where understanding and applying AI have become integral components of digital literacy,
reflected across various levels, including digital awareness, digital skills, digital thinking,
and digital ethics. Both teachers and students should grasp the basic concepts, history, major
technologies, and application areas of Artificial Intelligence. This involves understanding
the processes of data collection, cleansing, analysis, and interpretation related to generative
AI, as well as mastering the fundamental concepts of AI algorithms and their problemsolving capabilities. Effective interactions with generative AI systems, including usage
methods, command formats, and scripting tools, should be learned to enhance human–
machine communication skills. Simultaneously, understanding the technical limitations
of generative AI, including potential fairness, transparency, interpretability, bias, and
reasoning errors of large language models, is essential. Continuous learning and knowledge
updates are necessary to adapt to the changes brought about by the AI era.
Enhancing digital literacy and understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI
systems is crucial for knowing where they can assist and when human intervention is
required. When individuals have sufficient understanding and mastery of generative AI
and digital resources, they may develop a greater interest in generative learning, driving
them to explore and delve deeper. By integrating digital literacy with intrinsic motivation,
a more engaging learning environment can be created, stimulating individuals’ enthusiasm
for learning and fostering innovation.

Exploring human integration with generative Artificial Intelligence: transforming
teacher perspectives

Systems 2024, 12, 332

16 of 19

In generative AI-driven interactive learning environments, the fusion of humans
and machines necessitates a shift for teachers from traditional knowledge transmitters to
learning facilitators. In traditional teaching models, teachers primarily engage in knowledge impartation tasks, whereas the application of generative AI enables students to
autonomously acquire knowledge and information. Therefore, teachers need to redefine
their roles, emphasizing igniting students’ learning interests and nurturing their innovation
abilities and problem-solving skills. Simultaneously, teachers must also address potential
issues and challenges brought about by generative AI. When utilizing generative teaching
resources, critical thinking is essential. Teachers should meticulously select and utilize
instructional materials to ensure their correctness in terms of values and objectives.
The shift in teachers’ perspectives also requires a profound consideration of educational objectives. Future education should prioritize the cultivation of students’ comprehensive qualities and innovation capabilities rather than solely pursue knowledge mastery.
Consequently, teachers need to re-examine their educational philosophies, adapt to complex intelligent teaching environments, and make students’ holistic development the core
objective of teaching. This entails transitioning from an emphasis on theoretical knowledge
to prioritizing the cultivation of students’ practical skills, critical thinking, and creativity.

The generative learning process requires learners to construct perceptions of problems,
scenarios, and experiences, facilitating a deeper comprehension of knowledge rather than
passively receiving information. Integrating generative learning into generative AI-driven
interactive learning environments and learning strategies entails encouraging students to
focus on reasoning and reflection, mastering the analysis, decomposition, and evaluation of
each step of complex problems. Generative AI can enhance reasoning and reflection abilities
through techniques like prompting through thought chains and guiding large language
models to generate explicit intermediate reasoning steps before producing final answers.
This technique has been proven to significantly enhance the performance of generative
AI across various reasoning tasks. Generative AI can be pre-trained or fine-tuned using
datasets containing explicit reasoning to strengthen its ability to handle complex reasoning
problems, including deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning forms.
The reasoning process of generative AI for problem-solving can promote students’
reflection on the learning process rather than simply generating answers. Referring to the
analytical process of generative AI based on deep learning algorithms as “inference” rather
than mere “computation” is because this process emulates human reasoning or decisionmaking processes. The primary function of deep learning algorithms is to learn from
complex, high-dimensional data and extract patterns, resembling the process of concluding
observations—a form of reasoning. It is also effective in applications such as prediction,
decision-making, handling uncertainty, and dealing with fuzzy problems. Additionally, it
can adapt to new data patterns through fine-tuning, similar to human cognitive learning
processes.

Enhancing generative learning experiences: boosting self-efficacy

Based on multimodal large-scale models, generative AI can generate various data
types such as text, images, audio, and 3D models, providing personalized learning experiences for students. Moreover, multimodal large-scale models can utilize techniques like
Multimodal Instruction Fine-Tuning (M-IT), Multimodal Implicit Context Learning (MICL), Multimodal Chains of Thought (M-CoT), and Large-scale Assisted Visual Reasoning
(LAVR) to mimic human perception of the world. This enables interactive instruction–
response pairs, including multimodal dialogues, factual knowledge reasoning dialogues,
image and 3D scene descriptions, visual feature generalization, and even the conversion
of visual and linguistic inputs into concrete reasoning, facilitating context-aware human–
machine interaction.
With support from multimodal generative AI, multimedia educational content no
longer requires manual editing. Teachers can better utilize text, audio, video, animations,

and interactive elements to enhance learning experiences. By combining various forms
such as instructional videos, virtual laboratories, and interactive courseware, teachers
can generate customized learning content, enhancing student interaction with the instructional materials, meeting their learning needs and preferences, and fostering interest
and participation.
This study, through profound consideration of the transformation of generative learning models, constructs and validates a conceptual model that examines the relationships
among self-efficacy, learning motivation, strategies, technological acceptance, and teacher
support, illustrating how generative AI fosters emergent learning models. Empirically, it
explores how to promote educational intelligence and digital transformation. However,
this study has limitations, primarily concerning the subjective perceptions of the survey
respondents, leading to uncertainties. Future research should corroborate these findings
with additional data and account for external objective factors. Collecting more qualitative
data through various channels such as interviews, observations, and classroom recordings
can provide richer information. Longitudinal studies can observe changes in students’
self-directed learning abilities over time in generative AI-driven interactive learning environments. Additionally, considering other factors that may affect self-directed learning,
such as learning styles, personality traits, and emotional factors, and incorporating them
into the analysis is crucial. Amidst this, the teacher’s role in imparting ethical guidance
for AI usage becomes critical. Future research is called upon to explore how teachers
ensure students’ ethical application of AI, including, but not limited to, data privacy and
social impacts.
