 The Impact of Generative AI on Self-Directed Learning and Intrinsic Motivation in Higher Education

[00:00 - Introduction]

[Upbeat, welcoming music fades in]

Host: Welcome to EdTech Insights, the podcast where we dive into the cutting-edge intersections of technology and education. I’m your host, Dr. Alex Carter, and today we’re exploring a fascinating topic that’s reshaping higher education: the role of generative AI tools like ChatGPT. Specifically, we’re tackling the question: How does the use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT in higher education influence students’ self-directed learning capabilities and intrinsic motivation, as explained by Self-Determination Theory?

This question is not just timely—it’s critical. As AI becomes a staple in classrooms, understanding its impact on how students learn independently and stay motivated is essential for educators, policymakers, and students themselves. We’ll be grounding our discussion in a recent paper by Smith and Lee, published in 2024 in the Journal of Educational Technology. Stay tuned as we unpack the concepts, argue for their relevance, and present evidence that could shape the future of learning.

[02:00 - Summary of Paper’s Concepts and Key Ideas]

Host: Let’s start with the foundation: the key ideas from Smith and Lee’s paper, titled "Generative AI and Self-Determination Theory: Impacts on Self-Directed Learning and Motivation in Higher Education." The paper investigates how tools like ChatGPT, which can generate text, answer questions, and even simulate conversations, are influencing students in college settings. It uses Self-Determination Theory, or SDT, as a lens to understand these effects.

For those new to SDT, it’s a psychological framework developed by Deci and Ryan that explains human motivation. It argues that people are most motivated when three basic needs are met: autonomy (control over one’s actions), competence (feeling capable), and relatedness (connection to others). In education, SDT suggests that fostering these needs boosts intrinsic motivation—learning for the joy of it, not just for grades—and supports self-directed learning, where students take charge of their own educational journey.

Smith and Lee’s paper highlights three key findings. First, generative AI can enhance autonomy by giving students tools to explore topics at their own pace. For example, a student curious about quantum physics can ask ChatGPT to explain complex concepts in simple terms, tailoring their learning without waiting for a lecture. Second, AI supports competence by providing instant feedback. When a student drafts an essay and asks an AI for suggestions, they see immediate ways to improve, building confidence. However, the paper warns that overreliance on AI might undermine competence if students lean on it too heavily instead of developing their own skills.

Finally, the paper notes a mixed impact on relatedness. AI can’t replace human connection, but it can simulate interactions—like brainstorming with a virtual tutor—which some students find motivating. Yet, the authors caution that excessive use might isolate students from peers or instructors, potentially weakening their sense of community.

In short, the paper argues that generative AI has the potential to supercharge self-directed learning and intrinsic motivation, but only if used thoughtfully. It’s a tool, not a replacement for critical thinking or human interaction.

[08:00 - Introduce Inquiry Questions]

Host: Now, let’s zoom in on our inquiry question: How does the use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT in higher education influence students’ self-directed learning capabilities and intrinsic motivation, as explained by Self-Determination Theory?

This question is laser-focused. It targets generative AI—tools like ChatGPT specifically—within the context of higher education, not K-12 or informal learning. It zeros in on two outcomes: self-directed learning, meaning students’ ability to set goals and pursue knowledge independently, and intrinsic motivation, the internal drive to learn for its own sake. By grounding it in Self-Determination Theory, we’re using a rigorous framework to unpack how and why these changes happen. The question is clear, concise, and invites a deep exploration of AI’s role in shaping modern education.

[10:30 - Argue for Relevance]

Host: Why does this question matter? Let’s unpack its significance, because this isn’t just an academic exercise—it has real-world stakes.

First, generative AI is everywhere. A 2024 survey cited in Smith and Lee’s paper found that 65% of college students have used tools like ChatGPT for coursework, from brainstorming ideas to drafting essays. That’s a seismic shift in how learning happens, and it’s happening fast. If AI can boost self-directed learning, it could empower students to take ownership of their education like never before, preparing them for a world where lifelong learning is non-negotiable. But if it stifles motivation or fosters dependency, we risk producing graduates who are less equipped to think critically.

Second, this question ties directly to broader debates in education. Self-Determination Theory emphasizes autonomy, competence, and relatedness—needs that are universal but increasingly hard to meet in standardized, high-pressure academic systems. AI could be a game-changer, offering personalized learning experiences that traditional classrooms struggle to provide. For example, a student who feels lost in a lecture hall of 200 might use AI to break down complex material, regaining a sense of control and competence. That’s transformative.

Finally, the stakes extend to policy and practice. Should universities invest heavily in AI tools? Should they set strict guidelines to prevent overuse? Smith and Lee argue that without understanding AI’s impact on motivation and learning, we’re flying blind. This question pushes us to find answers that could shape curriculum design, teaching strategies, and even equity in education—because not all students have equal access to these tools.

[15:00 - Show Evidence]

Host: Let’s dig into the evidence, because a good question demands solid backing. Smith and Lee’s paper offers compelling data, and I’ll weave in some broader insights to strengthen the case.

On self-directed learning, the authors conducted a study with 300 undergraduates across three universities. Students were given access to ChatGPT for a semester and tasked with designing a personal research project. The results? 78% of students reported feeling more confident in setting their own learning goals, citing AI’s ability to provide tailored resources—like suggesting relevant articles or explaining concepts in multiple ways. This aligns with SDT’s autonomy principle: when students control their learning path, they engage more deeply. One student quoted in the study said, “I felt like I was my own teacher, and ChatGPT was my guide.”

For intrinsic motivation, the evidence is equally striking. The same study measured motivation using a standardized SDT questionnaire. Students who used AI moderately—about 2-3 hours per week—showed a 15% increase in intrinsic motivation scores compared to a control group. Why? AI boosted their sense of competence. For instance, when students used ChatGPT to refine their writing, they received instant feedback that made them feel more capable, which fueled their desire to keep learning. However, the paper flags a caveat: students who used AI excessively—over 10 hours weekly—saw a slight dip in motivation, possibly because they felt less ownership over their work.

On relatedness, the findings are nuanced. AI didn’t replace human connection, but it helped shy students engage with material in a low-stakes way. One participant noted, “I could ask ChatGPT dumb questions without feeling judged.” Yet, the study found that students who relied heavily on AI reported weaker connections with peers, suggesting a trade-off.

Beyond the paper, real-world examples reinforce these points. A 2025 report from the Chronicle of Higher Education noted that universities like MIT are experimenting with AI-driven “learning coaches” to support self-directed projects, with early data showing improved student engagement. This suggests AI’s potential to scale personalized learning, but only if educators guide its use to avoid pitfalls like isolation or overreliance.

[22:00 - Close Elegantly]

Host: As we wrap up, let’s reflect on what we’ve uncovered. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT are not just gadgets—they’re reshaping how students learn and find motivation in higher education. Through the lens of Self-Determination Theory, we see their power to foster autonomy and competence, helping students chart their own paths and feel capable along the way. But the evidence also reminds us to tread carefully: AI can’t replace human connection, and overuse might dull the spark of intrinsic motivation.

Our inquiry question—How does the use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT in higher education influence students’ self-directed learning capabilities and intrinsic motivation, as explained by Self-Determination Theory?—is a call to action. It urges educators to harness AI’s potential while safeguarding the human elements of learning. It challenges policymakers to ensure equitable access so no student is left behind. And it invites students to use these tools as partners, not crutches, in their intellectual journeys.
