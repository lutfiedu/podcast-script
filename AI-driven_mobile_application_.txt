In the ever-evolving landscape of education, the digital age has become the catalyst for
transformative change, reshaping traditional paradigms and ushering in a new era of
pedagogical possibilities. In tandem with this revolution, reading comprehension is vital in
the digital age, as people are exposed to various types of texts and media online. However,
screen reading often leads to multitasking and distractions, presenting unique challenges
compared to paper, including information overload. (Liu, 2022). Therefore, students must
develop strategies to effectively comprehend and retain what they read in digital
environments. Studies (Chi, 2024 and Orellana et al., 2024) emphasize that reading

comprehension remains a global challenge, with students grappling to attain proficiency. In
addition, UNICEF’s 2022 report reveals a critical global education crisis: 64% of 10-year-olds
lack basic reading skills, highlighting an urgent need for worldwide educational reform.
(UNICEF, 2022). Furthermore, the Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics (SEA-PLM) 2019
report showed the lowest reading, writing, and mathematics capability among Filipino 5th
graders. In the Philippine setting, the Department of Education (DepEd) acknowledges the
need for targeted interventions to address reading comprehension issues among students
(DepEd, 2021). Moreover, reading online requires different strategies and skills than reading
on paper, such as skimming, scanning, browsing, and keyword searching (Azmi et al., 2020).
The persistent issues in reading comprehension, both on a global scale and within the
Philippine context, highlight the immediate necessity; there is a critical demand for inventive
solutions to captivate and inspire students.
Introducing Artificial Intelligence (AI) into educational technology presents a promising
avenue for addressing these challenges. As Hwang et al. (2020) posited AI’s potential to
transform learning experiences lies in its ability to tailor content delivery, adjust individual
learning styles, and elevate overall engagement. The infusion of AI into educational
technology represents a paradigm shift, allowing for the creation of intelligent, responsive,
and motivating learning environments. (Walter, 2024 and Aristanto et al., 2023)
One way to enhance reading comprehension in the digital age is to use AI-driven mobile
applications to provide personalized and adaptive support for learners. Li et al. (2022) explore
the core characteristics of AI apps, shedding light on features, functionalities and trends.
However, more studies must be done on how AI-driven mobile applications can incorporate
motivational features based on the student’s preferences that engage and sustain students’
interest and effort in reading comprehension tasks. Motivational features, such as feedback,
rewards, goals, choices, challenges, and social interaction, can influence students’ intrinsic
and extrinsic motivation (Ryan and Deci, 2020). Understanding students’ motivational
feature preferences is essential for designing effective AI-driven mobile applications catering
to their diverse needs and preferences. As of the authors’ knowledge, no study has focused on
identifying the theory-based motivational preferences of students to be incorporated into AIdriven mobile applications to boost comprehension in the Philippine context. The primary
objective of this study is to investigate users’ preferences for motivational features,
specifically those aligned with self-determination theory (SDT) with autonomy, relatedness,
and competency, within AI-driven mobile applications aimed at enhancing reading
comprehension. The study aims to identify the motivational features that users find most
appealing and effective in fostering a sense of autonomy, promoting relatedness, and
enhancing feelings of competency in AI-driven mobile apps in the context of reading
comprehension. By exploring user preferences, the research seeks to inform the designers
and developers of AI-driven mobile applications that align with users’ motivational needs,
ultimately contributing to creating more engaging and user-friendly platforms for improving
reading comprehension skills.

Over the last decade, there has been a substantial transition toward online learning, marking
a dynamic digital transformation in the educational landscape that reshapes the learning
environment. Sum and Oancea (2022) provide a comprehensive analysis, highlighting the
adaptation of innovation and technology integration to foster better engagement and
support. In addition, as noted by Okoye et al. (2023), digital technologies have become integral
to educational practices, influencing how knowledge is acquired and disseminated. Allen and
Seaman’s annual reports on Online Learning in Higher Education (2020) reveal a steady
increase in students engaging in online courses, highlighting the growing prominence of

digital platforms. Another notable review by Keshavarz and Mirmoghtadaie (2023) discusses
the evolution of educational technology and its integration into traditional learning
environments. The 2021 EDUCAUSE Horizon Report examined how incorporating Open
Educational Resources (OER) into teaching syllabi can boost students’ involvement and
active participation. This integration is highlighted as a method to potentially increase
educational engagement, offering a more interactive and inclusive learning experience. This
phenomenon reveals a complex interplay of drivers, challenges, opportunities, and impacts.
Several studies underscore the transformative potential of digital tools in enhancing student
outcomes, with personalized learning experiences positively affecting achievement,
motivation, and engagement (Walter, 2024; Ahmad Bhat, 2023; Deci and Ryan, 1985).
However, studies show that challenges like disparities in access and skills and resistance to
change necessitate a nuanced implementation strategy (Mikhailov et al., 2024).
Comprehending written text is an intricate cognitive skill encompassing tasks such as
decoding words, grasping their meanings, establishing connections between sentences and
paragraphs, drawing inferences, and vigilantly monitoring one’s understanding (Capodieci
et al., 2020). Proficiency in reading comprehension is a fundamental skill crucial for achieving
academic success and fostering lifelong learning. However, reading comprehension in the
digital age poses new challenges and opportunities for learners and educators. Reading
online requires strategies and skills different from reading on paper, such as skimming,
scanning, browsing, and keyword searching (Azmi et al., 2020). Online readers also need to
evaluate the credibility, relevance, and accuracy of multiple sources of information and
integrate them into a coherent understanding of the topic, as mentioned by Klimova and
Zamborova (2020). The literature on reading comprehension in the digital age has explored
various aspects of this complex phenomenon (Capodieci et al., 2020; Kiili et al., 2024; Kumar
and Dhar, 2023). The literature underscores the importance of cultivating skills specific to
online reading while recognizing the multifaceted aspects influencing comprehension in the
ever-evolving digital age.
Utilizing technology can be a valuable resource to bolster reading comprehension by
granting access to diverse texts, amplifying motivation and engagement, providing support
in comprehension processes, and streamlining feedback and assessment. OECD (2021)
emphasizes that in today’s digital age, the sheer volume of information requires readers to
differentiate factual content from personal viewpoints, effectively enhancing critical literacy
skills. In addition, scholars suggest some implications for teaching and learning reading
comprehension in the digital age (Zuo et al., 2023; Saroyan, 2022). Scholars emphasize the
importance of embracing digital advantages, providing explicit instruction in online reading
strategies, encouraging diverse reading experiences, and fostering critical thinking in
online tasks.
The emergence of AI-driven solutions in educational technology is a promising trend
that has the potential to transform learning outcomes, enhance teacher practice, and foster
skills and values that are essential for the future. According to UNESCO, AI can help
address some of the most significant educational challenges today, such as access, quality,
equity, and inclusion, while ensuring that human-centered principles guide its application.
AI can also accelerate students’ holistic development by providing personalized learning,
real-time feedback, and opportunities for critical thinking and problem-solving (Kopp and
Thomsen, 2023). Moreover, Artificial intelligence can enhance the gratification of teaching
by automating responsibilities like lesson planning and grading, allowing teachers to focus
on building relationships and providing guidance to students (Ibrahim, 2023). Furthermore,
Exploring attitudes, preferences, and needs towards AI-informed mobile mental health
apps among young people (G€otzl et al., 2022) and investigating the impacts of mobileassisted vocabulary learning outside the classroom using digital flashcards for English as
Foreign Language learners (Rahmani et al., 2022), neither study delves into the motivational

preferences of students in AI-driven mobile apps based on the theoretical framework of
SDT principles, with the former focusing on mental health and the latter on vocabulary
learning.
Additionally, a study by Xodabande and Hashemi (2022) on learning English with
electronic textbooks on mobile devices does not address the motivational preferences of
students in AI-driven mobile apps based on the SDT framework, emphasizing vocabulary
learning instead of language comprehension. In addition, AI-driven mobile applications are
emerging technologies that use AI to provide personalized and adaptive support for reading
comprehension. These applications harness the power of AI to analyze students’ reading
behaviors, preferences, strengths, and weaknesses; to provide feedback, guidance, and
scaffolding; and to adapt the content, difficulty level, and pace of reading activities according
to student’s needs and goals (ten Have and Patr~ao Neves, 2021).
Theoretical framework
Motivational feature preferences refer to the degree to which learners prefer certain features
or elements in an educational technology designed to enhance their motivation, such as
timely feedback, rewards, challenges, social interaction, goal-setting aids and others, as Jin
et al. (2023) noted. According to Jin et al. (2023), the multifaceted nature of students may have
different motivational feature preferences depending on various factors, such as learning
goals, self-efficacy, interest, and prior experience. Reflecting on Reinders et al. (2022),
understanding learners’ motivational feature preferences can help educators and designers
create more effective and engaging educational technology supporting learners’ autonomy,
competence, and relatedness. The theoretical framework guiding this study is the selfdetermination theory (SDT) established by Deci and Ryan (1985), a widely used theory of
human motivation that distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. As
highlighted by Hsiao and Bi et al. (2024), neglecting the exploration of the motivation behind
technological engagement can lead to a potential shift towards a more technology-dependent
lifestyle. With a nuanced understanding of the underlying motivational factors, the benefits
derived from such technological activities may be protected.
A theoretical framework that can help address this challenge is SDT, which proposes that
human motivation and well-being hinge on fulfilling three fundamental psychological
needs—autonomy, competence, and relatedness (Deci and Ryan, 1985). Autonomy is the
feeling one has a choice and willingly endorsing one’s behavior; competence refers to mastery
and effectiveness in one’s tasks; and relatedness is the need to feel connected and
belongingness with others (Mayo et al., (2022). Following SDT, fulfilling these needs enhances
the likelihood of students experiencing intrinsic motivation characterized by inherent interest
and enjoyment in learning rather than relying on extrinsic motivation, which involves
pursuing external rewards or responding to external pressures (Ryan and Deci, 2020).
In the context of AI-driven mobile apps, SDT can provide opportunities for students to
exercise autonomy, competence, and relatedness in their learning process. For example, an
app could allow students to choose their learning goals, topics, and pace and provide
feedback and support tailored to their needs and preferences. An app could also enable
students to monitor their progress and achievements and challenge them with tasks that are
optimally matched to their skill level and learning style. An app could facilitate social
interaction and collaboration among students and foster community and shared purpose
(Wang et al., 2022). By applying SDT principles to designing and developing AI-driven mobile
apps, educators and developers can enhance students’ motivation and engagement in digital
learning and improve their comprehension outcomes. Research has shown that meeting the
three basic psychological needs significantly positively affects intrinsic motivation,
increasing students’ psychological engagement in online learning environments (Pan, 2023).

Additionally, AI can incorporate gamified elements, such as rewards, badges,
leaderboards, and challenges, making reading more fun and engaging for learners
(Almusaed et al., 2023). Mobile apps driven by AI can have a higher level of engagement
and efficacy if the proper incentive framework is used. Moreover, intrinsic motivation has
been linked to higher levels of cognitive processing, deeper understanding, and better
retention of information (Ryan and Deci, 2000). Therefore, by supporting students’ autonomy,
competence, and relatedness in AI-driven mobile apps, educators and developers can create
more effective and enjoyable learning experiences.
There needs to be more related literature needs to be thoroughly investigated regarding
the motivational preferences of students in AI-driven mobile apps that can be designed and
developed to enhance learner motivation based on the theoretical framework of SDT
principles to boost reading comprehension.
Methodology
This research utilizes a mixed-methods design, combining quantitative and qualitative
methodologies. The research focuses on comprehensively exploring student preferences
within AI-driven mobile applications for reading comprehension. The study aims to provide a
nuanced understanding of motivational feature preferences by combining qualitative and
quantitative results. This approach ensures a thorough examination aligned with objectives,
allowing for a holistic analysis of the motivational features that users find most appealing
and effective in fostering a sense of autonomy, promoting relatedness, and enhancing feelings
of competency in an AI-driven mobile app in the context of reading comprehension. While
specific references and sources may vary based on the literature, but this design draws
inspiration from Creswell’s work on mixed-methods research (Creswell, 2014; Creswell and
Clark, 2017). Utilizing methodological triangulation can improve research findings’ quality,
comprehensiveness, validity, and understanding. It also proves beneficial as it helps
circumvent the shortcomings and research biases associated solely with a single research
approach (Bhandari, 2023), a practice also employed in this study.
Population
Data were obtained from 71 Baguio City National Science High School (BCNSHS) respondents
only. The respondents were between 12 and 20 years old; 59.2% were female, and 40.8% were
male. 15.5% were at the grade 7 level, 15.5% were in grade 8, 7% were in grade 10, 47.9%
were in grade 11 and 14.1% were in grade 12 level students. An interview with five students
was conducted to add to the data collected.
Procedures
The theoretical framework employed in this study highlights the fundamental psychological
needs, including autonomy, competence, and relatedness, as Deci and Ryan (1985) outlined,
which guided the researcher in developing the questionnaire for this study. Survey questions
underwent content validation, such as subject expert review, which was collected to validate
the questionnaire and calculate the content validity index. Content validity is vital to ensure
overall validity (Yusoff, 2019). The first phase of the research involved administering
structured online surveys to a sample of 71 participants in Baguio City National Science High
School (BCNSHS). A scale on the Likert scale, extending from 1–5, was utilized along with
open-ended questions to gauge participant preferences. The quantitative data was analyzed
using descriptive statistics. JASP statistical software is a freely available open-source tool
(JASP Team, 2023) used for descriptive statistics in this study. The second phase of the
research involved conducting in-depth interviews through video calls to 5 participants, using

semi-structured questions to explore their motivations, experiences, and opinions in more
detail. In the third phase, qualitative data was used for thematic analysis. The interviews
were transcribed verbatim, identifying patterns and coding open-ended questions into
categories that capture the variety of answers. This was conducted to help quantify and
analyze the additional information provided by the respondents. The fourth phase of the
research involved integrating the findings from both phases, using triangulation,
complementarity, or expansion strategies to achieve a holistic understanding of the
phenomenon (Johnson and Onwuegbuzie, 2004). The triangulation approach was employed
to integrate findings from interviews and surveys. By merging interview and survey data,
highlighting commonalities and differences to build a robust understanding of the subject.
The integrated analysis of quantitative and qualitative findings comprehensively explores
students’ motivational feature preferences in AI-driven mobile applications. The study
adhered to ethical principles and standards, ensuring informed consent, confidentiality,
anonymity, and voluntary participation of the participants. Before commencing the study,
the research proposal underwent ethical scrutiny and approval from the Institutional Review
Board (IRB). However, the study also has some potential limitations that must be
acknowledged. First, the statistical power and generalizability of the results might be
constrained by the study design and sample size. The study used a convenience sample of
students from one school - BCNSHS, which may not represent the broader population of
students who use AI-driven mobile applications such as Duolingo, ChatGPT, Text to Speech
and others used by the students to boost their reading comprehension. Second, the study may
need help collecting data, such as low response rates or ethical concerns. The study employed
strategies to mitigate these challenges, such as providing incentives and obtaining informed
consent.

Results and discussion
The survey consisted of nine structured and three semi-structured questions that aimed to
evaluate the preferences of students regarding motivational features to be integrated with the
AI-driven mobile app based on the three psychological motivations: autonomy, relatedness,
and satisfaction. The survey had 71 respondents and used a Likert scale. The number 5 is
assigned to Strongly Agree responses, 4 for Agree, 3 for Neutral, 2 for Disagree, and 1 for
Strongly Disagree see Table 1 below. To compute the Average Weighted Mean (AWM),
descriptive statistics, as shown in Table 2 below, were performed using statistical tools such
as JASP Analysis Tools.
The survey outcomes offer valuable insights into students’ preferences and perceptions
regarding using AI-driven mobile applications for reading comprehension. The study aimed
to pinpoint the satisfaction, attitude, and impact of the different AI-mobile apps such as
chatbots, Google Translate, Duolingo and others that users find most appealing and effective
in fostering autonomy, promoting relatedness, and enhancing feelings of competency within

these applications, ultimately providing a holistic understanding of students’ attitudes and
preferences in this context.
Frequency of usage
The first question, probing the frequency of using AI-driven mobile applications for reading
comprehension, revealed a mean response of 2.394. It suggests that students engage with
these applications occasionally or rarely, indicating a relatively low level of involvement.
Perceived effectiveness
The second question, assessing the perceived effectiveness of AI-driven mobile applications
in enhancing reading comprehension skills, yielded a mean response of 3.197. Students
expressed a somewhat neutral to slightly positive stance, indicating a perceived benefit but
not a robust one.
Importance of motivational features
The third question, focusing on the importance of motivational features, generated a mean
response of 3.127. Students demonstrated a somewhat neutral to slightly positive view,
suggesting varied valuations of motivational aspects.
Autonomy level
The fourth question, addressing the level of autonomy in choosing engagement with AIdriven mobile applications, resulted in a mean response of 3.113. Students appeared neutral to
slightly positive, indicating a perceived but not substantial level of autonomy.
Relatedness
The fifth question, assessing the level of relatedness with peers and educators during AI
application use, yielded an average response of 2.704. Students fell within the neutral range
and did not feel strongly connected or disconnected during application use.

Satisfaction
The sixth question, inquiring about students’ satisfaction with the overall experience of using
AI-driven mobile applications, resulted in a mean response of 3.141. Students exhibited a
mixed or moderate evaluation of their experience.
The survey question data shows the most popular motivational features in AI-driven
mobile applications for reading comprehension that they find most helpful or enjoyable. The
most agreed features, as depicted in Figure 1, were progress tracking (50.7%), personalization
(49.3%), and challenges (47.9%), followed by social interaction (47.9%), feedback (46.5%),
goals (46.5%), gamification (45.1%), and rewards (31%). The other category (4.2%) included
responses that were either irrelevant, negative, or unclear, such as “I do not know”, “I have
never used AI”, “none”, and “memorization”. These responses suggest that some respondents
may need help understanding the concept and benefits of AI-driven mobile applications for
reading comprehension or may have reservations or misconceptions about them. The
respondents valued features that can support their self-regulated learning, such as progress
tracking, personalization, and challenges, as well as features that can foster their social and
emotional engagement, such as social interaction and feedback, which aligns with
Zimmerman’s idea (Zhang et al., 2024). These features can help users monitor their
learning process, adjust their learning strategies, set realistic and attainable goals, overcome
difficulties, receive timely and constructive feedback, and interact with others with similar
interests or challenges.
On the other hand, the respondents showed less agreement on features that can provide
extrinsic motivation, such as rewards and gamification, which may indicate that they
preferred intrinsic motivation over external incentives. The study by Liu et al., (2022) revealed
that while immediate rewards may initially boost a person’s inherent interest in an activity,
this influence tends to wane as the person develops a natural motivation for the activity over
time. Essentially, the initial external incentives serve as a catalyst for engagement, but as
one’s internal drive strengthens, the reliance on these external rewards decreases.
The survey question aimed to identify which motivational features are least helpful or
enjoyable for users of AI-driven mobile applications for reading comprehension. Responses
showed that the most disliked features, as shown in Figure 2, were challenges (31%),
feedback (28.2%), social interaction (26.8%), and personalization (26.8%). The least disliked
features were progress tracking (14.5%) and the other choice (4.3%). This result suggests that
users prefer more autonomy and control over their learning process rather than being
pressured by external factors such as competition, evaluation, or social comparison. Hence,
this research indicates and reinforces that intrinsic motivation fosters a greater willingness

among learners to take responsibility for the outcome, underscoring that granting students
increased autonomy results in intrinsic motivation (Bandhu et al., 2024). Based on SDT,
intrinsic motivation is enhanced when learners perceive that they have autonomy,
competence, and relatedness in their learning activities. Therefore, AI-driven mobile
applications for reading comprehension should consider how to design motivational features
that support these psychological needs rather than undermine them. For example, feedback
could be more informative and constructive, rather than judgmental or punitive; rewards
could be more meaningful and aligned with learners’ goals, rather than arbitrary or extrinsic;
and social interaction could be more collaborative and supportive, rather than competitive or
distracting (Ryan and Deci, 2000).
To examine open-ended questions, the responses regarding students’ preferences on
motivational features supporting autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs for reading
comprehension uncover sub-themes by breaking down the themes according to the SDT and
breaking them down to arrive sub-themes as depicted in Table 3. Respondents emphasized
the importance of incorporating user control and personalization by personalizing and
customizing content and settings, as well as feedback and progress tracking by allowing
users to set and track their reading goals. About relatedness, preferences were mentioned,
such as creating a social component of the app and implementing features like virtual study
groups to foster a sense of community. In the context of competence, gamification and
rewards, they suggest features like leaderboards and quizzes to maintain user engagement.
The finding also coincides with the research of Mishra and Malhotra (2021). As
participants interact with the gamified setting, they willingly engage in virtual challenges to
experience enjoyment and play, fundamental aspects inherent in human nature. Intrinsically
motivated activities are pursuits that individuals find inherently interesting and engage in
without external influences, deriving pleasure solely from the act. In addition, incorporating
fun and engaging activities, including progress charts and animations, will make the learning
experience enjoyable. Other recommendations included the integration of inbuilt narration
for improved story comprehension and expert-verified situations aligned with AI-generated
statements.
Additionally, one respondent suggested making the app accessible offline to
accommodate users with limited mobile data. By integrating these diverse suggestions,
developers have the opportunity to enhance the motivational features of AI-driven mobile
applications, ultimately improving the overall learning experience for users.

customization, personalization, user control, convenience, and AI experience. This finding
supports the study of Luo et al. (2023) that customization and personalization affect users’
continued intention to use technology. Respondents suggest that features like personalized
recommendations, customizable settings, adaptive learning, goal tracking, and the ability to
collect data contribute to autonomy by empowering users to choose reading materials aligned
with their preferences and adjust difficulty levels. Social interaction features, including
connecting with other readers and participating in reading communities, promote relatedness
by cultivating a sense of belonging and enabling discussions. Another study by Miao and Ma
(2022) emphasizes that significant learning happens through interaction, knowledge, and
experience sharing. Progress tracking is highlighted in enhancing competence with features
that provide a challenging yet manageable reading experience, fostering continuous learning
and improvement. Gamification features, such as interactive quizzes and leaderboards,
emerged in responses by creating an enjoyable learning environment that motivates users to
read and progress.
Table 5 presents the responses and various recommendations for optimizing AI-driven
mobile apps to meet users’ effective motivation needs to be rooted in autonomy, competence,
and relatedness. Key emerging themes include the emphasis on customization and user
preferences, with respondents highlighting the significance of features like personalized
recommendations, adjustable difficulty levels, and the ability to set personal reading goals to
bolster autonomy. Fostering relatedness is another prominent theme, emphasizing social
features and collaboration, inclusive messaging and support, and engaging and fun

believe AI-driven mobile applications effectively enhance reading comprehension skills. In
addition, some suggested features from the respondents were gamification, progress
tracking, and challenges, which were identified as enhancing competence in the
qualitative data.
Furthermore, Social interaction is critical in fostering relatedness in qualitative and
quantitative data. Qualitative findings suggest creating a social component to the app,
while quantitative results show the popularity of social interaction features. The mean
response of 2.704 indicates a moderate level of relatedness when using AI-driven mobile
apps for reading comprehension. Social interaction features, virtual study groups, and
creating a sense of community are identified as essential for fostering relatedness and were
suggested in some of the responses by creating a social component to the app. Despite the
similarities, there are differences in the liking and disliking of specific features between the
qualitative and quantitative data. For example, challenges are highlighted as disliked in
quantitative results, while gamification and challenges are emphasized positively in
qualitative findings.
Moreover, the qualitative data provides nuanced recommendations, such as integrating
built-in narration, expert-verified situations, and offline accessibility. The quantitative
survey results should explicitly capture these detailed suggestions for improvement. Another
critical point is the need for inclusivity and accessibility, which is emphasized more explicitly
in the qualitative data. Also, a response from the interview stresses the importance of
considering features for users with disabilities, which is not explicitly mentioned in the
structured results. Qualitative findings uncover specific sub-themes related to autonomy,
competence, and relatedness. These sub-themes, such as the importance of user control,
personalization, and social features, provide a richer understanding than quantitative ones.

Implications
The synthesis of findings suggests the need for a comprehensive development strategy that
incorporates both the commonalities and nuanced recommendations from qualitative and
quantitative data. Combining the strengths of both findings, a holistic user-centric approach
that integrates personalization, progress tracking, social interaction, and gamification is
crucial for effective app development. Recognizing that individual preferences may vary,
developers should consider tailoring features to accommodate a range of user needs, as
indicated by qualitative and quantitative insights. In addition, app creators should be
mindful of discrepancies in preferences, especially regarding certain features like challenges,
and strive to balance these differences in the design of AI-driven mobile apps. Customizable
features and user control in AI-driven mobile apps must also be considered to enhance
autonomy. Specific features like personalized recommendations, adjustable difficulty levels,
and goal tracking should be prioritized based on qualitative insights. Developers should
prioritize features contributing to skill improvement, including gamification elements like
quizzes and leaderboards. The qualitative emphasis on continuous learning and
improvement should guide the development of features that challenge users at a
manageable level. Developers should prioritize features that enhance a sense of
community and social interaction to foster relatedness. As the qualitative data suggests,
inclusivity, support, and engaging interactions should be integrated to create a positive user
experience.
Conclusions and recommendations
This study aimed to identify students’ motivational features and preferences for AI-driven
mobile apps to boost reading comprehension based on the self-determination theory.
Synthesizing qualitative and quantitative findings paints a comprehensive picture of user
preferences and expectations for AI-driven mobile apps focused on reading comprehension.
Both data types underscore the significance of personalization and autonomy, indicating that
users value the ability to tailor their experience with AI-driven mobile apps. Progress
tracking and gamification elements stand out as essential components for enhancing
competence, with users expressing a belief in the efficacy of AI apps for improving reading
comprehension skills. Creating a sense of community and incorporating social interaction
features are highlighted in qualitative and quantitative data, emphasizing the importance of
relatedness for a positive user experience. While challenges are disliked in quantitative
results, they are positively emphasized in qualitative findings. These differences underline
the importance of understanding nuanced user preferences and striking a balance in feature
design. The qualitative data provides nuanced and detailed recommendations, such as inbuilt
narration, expert-verified situations, and offline accessibility, enriching the understanding of
user expectations beyond what quantitative data alone can reveal. Qualitative insights
explicitly highlight the need for inclusivity, particularly for users with disabilities. This
emphasizes the importance of ensuring accessibility features in the app to cater to diverse
user needs. Developers should adopt a comprehensive development strategy integrating
qualitative and quantitative data insights, including personalization features, autonomy
support, competence-building elements, and social interaction components. A holistic usercentric approach is crucial, seamlessly integrating personalization, progress tracking, and
social interaction to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. Recognizing that user
preferences vary, developers should consider tailoring features to accommodate various
needs. Addressing discrepancies in feature preferences calls for a balanced design approach.
Inclusivity and accessibility should be prioritized; ensuring features cater to users with
disabilities and creating an inclusive environment for all users. Implementing a feedback loop
within the app will enable continuous improvement based on user experiences and

preferences. Regular updates can address evolving user needs and maintain app relevance.
By embracing a user-centric, inclusive, and adaptive approach, developers can create an
application that meets user expectations and evolves to exceed them over time.
