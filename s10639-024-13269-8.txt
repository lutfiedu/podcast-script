Abstract
Technology plays a pivotal role in shaping education through transformative
enhancements in learning experiences at various levels. ChatGPT has emerged as a
promising educational tool amid evolving technological landscapes. Although prior
scholars have explored ChatGPT’s educational use, emphasizing its potential, challenges, and perspectives from students and educators, there remains a notable gap in
understanding its utilization among undergraduates for self-directed learning. Thus,
this study aimed to investigate undergraduates’ acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT for self-directed learning based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use
of Technology (UTAUT) and self-directed learning with technology scale (SDLTS).
The study provides new insights for reforming educational strategies and policies,
emphasizing the UTAUT model’s efficacy in considering ChatGPT adoption. Data
collected from undergraduates at state universities in Sri Lanka via an online survey yielded 627 valid responses, analyzed using Smart PLS. The results revealed
that performance expectancy and social influence significantly impact the behavioral
intention of undergraduates to use ChatGPT, with no significant impact on effort
expectancy. Moreover, behavioral intention and facilitating conditions significantly
influenced ChatGPT use for self-directed learning among undergraduates.

2023). ChatGPT has become a popular tool reaching about one million subscriptions shortly after its introduction (De Angelis et al., 2023; Strzelecki et al., 2024).
It has revolutionized natural language processing and enabled widespread public
interaction with generative artificial intelligence. The technology behind ChatGPT
allows it to mimic human interaction, challenge assumptions, and provide valuable
insights (Kohnke et al., 2023; Sifat & Bhattacharya, 2023). ChatGPT is capable of
producing interactive human-like conversations and is a useful digital assistant that
uses basic and accessible language to help people grasp a wide range of complex
topics (Bhullar et al., 2024).
The emergence of ChatGPT attracted both the general public and scientific communities’ attention to the opportunities and challenges posed by the application of
artificial intelligence across various domains, including work, business, academia,
and science (Strzelecki et al., 2024). In the field of education, there exists a significant debate on using ChatGPT in education (Rana, 2023), and ChatGPT has
emerged as a prominent topic in academic discourse (Shahsavar & Choudhury,
2023).
The existing studies on ChatGPT have primarily examined the challenges and
opportunities associated with utilizing ChatGPT in the field of education (AlAfnan
et al., 2023; Lim et al., 2023); academic integrity issues of using ChatGPT (Perkins,
2023; Cotton et al., 2023); its’ implications of ChatGPT in education (Farrokhnia
et al., 2023; Gilson et al., 2023; Fergus et al., 2023); the application of ChatGPT in
research work (Burger et al., 2023; Ivanov & Soliman, 2023); students perspective
towards using ChatGPT (Shoufan, 2023; Strzelecki, 2023); and educators’ perspective towards using ChatGPT (Hays et al., 2023; Strzelecki et al., 2024). However,
there remains a gap in the literature related to the ChatGPT use for self-directed
learning in higher education.
The use of ChatGPT has a huge impact on education, and some scholars believe
that ChatGPT could potentially disrupt multiple industries, including education
(Rana, 2023). However, some argue that ChatGPT could potentially enhance students’ independent learning (Firat, 2023; Zhai, 2022) and facilitate adult learners’
self-directed learning, as it provides students with dynamic and interactive tools to
enhance their self-directed learning experiences (Lin, 2023).
According to Firat (2023), ChatGPT is a potential open education technology
as it may promote the independence and autonomy of self-directed learners while
still being efficient and adaptive. Furthermore, research reveals that ChatGPT can
enhance enthusiasm and involvement in self-directed learners by providing personalized assistance, guidance, and feedback (Haglund, 2023; Firat, 2023).
On the other hand, self-directed learning is an imperative educational strategy,
especially for higher education, that encourages independent learning, critical thinking, and deeper engagement with subjects by facilitating students to take on obligations in their learning path (Garrison, 1997).
Since the educational paradigm has expanded, incorporating modern technology
with self-directed learning has become a compelling investigation path. Despite the
expanding relevance of technology in education, there remains a substantial gap in
the literature and empirical evidence pertinent to the association between ChatGPT
and self-directed learning (Haglund, 2023; Strzelecki, 2023), particularly given the

Education and Information Technologies

distinctive setting of state universities in Sri Lanka. Moreover, prior studies had
suggested further investigations to explore the potential of ChatGPT in promoting autonomy in the education field, particularly in students’ self-directed learning
(Agustini, 2023; Firat, 2023). Hence, this study aimed to examine the acceptance
and utilization of ChatGPT in the context of self-directed learning among the undergraduates of state universities in Sri Lanka by employing the UTAUT (Venkatesh
et al., 2003).
The outcomes of this study are expected to contribute not merely to understanding ChatGPT’s role in self-directed learning but also to a more extensive discussion
on integrating technological advances in educational settings.
Examining undergraduates’ acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT for selfdirected learning yields significant benefits for educational settings in Sri Lanka.
Research shows that the didactic approach predominates in classrooms within developing countries, considerably affecting the quality of education, where resources are
one of the barriers to learner-centered education (Schweisfurth, 2011). Thus, this
study provides insights for creating a learning environment that encourages students
to manage their own learning process using ChatGPT as a resource.
Moreover, this study informs broader educational technology integration efforts
by assessing the effectiveness of digital tools such as ChatGPT in promoting selfdirected learning among undergraduates in Sri Lanka. By leveraging the capabilities
of ChatGPT, it can support undergraduates in establishing learning goals, identifying available resources, creating tailored learning plans, tracking their progress, and
reflecting on their educational experiences, ultimately facilitating the achievement
of self-directed learning.
Overall, understanding how undergraduates engage with ChatGPT not only provides insights into the integration of technology in education but also how undergraduates in Sri Lanka develop essential skills for improving learning outcomes in
modern educational contexts.
In light of the current educational landscape, the main objective of this study is to
explore the acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT as a tool for self-directed learning among undergraduates in Sri Lanka. The study seeks to understand how students
accept and use ChatGPT for their independent learning needs.
In addition to analyzing how students use ChatGPT, the study includes a comprehensive background analysis and a literature review, which examines existing academic studies on the role of ChatGPT in education. It synthesizes previous findings
on how ChatGPT has been used in different educational settings, offering a broader
context for the current study.
By focusing on the acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT for self-directed
learning, this study also aims to offer insights that can improve the integration of
AI in higher education. The findings will be beneficial to educators, policymakers,
and researchers who are interested in enhancing self-directed learning through AI
technologies.

2 Literature review
2.1 Role of ChatGPT in education
ChatGPT has become a useful tool in various domains (Kothgassner & Felnhofer,
2023; Magruder et al., 2023; Villarino & Villarino, 2023). In the field of education,
ChatGPT, as an AI-based chatbot, has attracted significant attention for its potential
to enrich learning experiences. However, the use of ChatGPT in education has generated a significant debate, with some academics accepting its development while
others criticizing it for its potential to encourage misconduct (Strzelecki, 2023). This
rapid expansion and adoption of ChatGPT have turned it into a prominent topic of
discussion, and several scholars have investigated the role of ChatGPT in education
from different perspectives.
Various opportunities and challenges associated with utilizing ChatGPT in
the educational context are investigated. For example, Lim et al. (2023) discussed
the four-fold paradoxes of ChatGPT in education from management educators’ perspective and concluded that in the future of education, embracing generative AI is
preferable to rejecting it. AlAfnan et al. (2023) also examined the opportunities and
challenges of ChatGPT for students and instructors by conducting theory and application-based ChatGPT tests, and the study revealed that ChatGPT could potentially
replace search engines, and that it helps students find answers to both theory- and
application-based inquiries. Regarding challenges, the study indicated that unethical
use of ChatGPT by students could result in decreased human intelligence and hinder
learning. Consuegra-Fernández et al. (2024) explained that the use of AI in education brings faculty members numerous challenges in maintaining academic standards, while Cebrián Cifuentes et al. (2024) showed the possibility of accomplishing
the positive impact of AI tools in education when faculty members are trained in
those tools properly.
Chiu (2023) presented the effects of ChatGPT in areas of learning, teaching, assessment, and administration; the discussion showed that ChatGPT can
positively influence learning through adaptive feedback and human–computer
dialogues. However, it is crucial to focus on the issues connected to academic
dishonesty and the necessity to refresh the policy. Similarly, Lee et al. (2024)
explored the educators’ views and found that although many educators admitted

Education and Information Technologies

to starting to adapt the assessments due to AI, they reported a lack of organizational support and unclear guidelines.
From the students’ perspective, Strzelecki (2023) identified habit, performance
expectancy, and hedonic motivation as the most significant factors influencing the
acceptance of ChatGPT but which have the potential of leading to overreliance on
AI for academic tasks. Subsequent to these outcomes, Arthur et al. (2024) pointed
out that age, gender, and experience influenced students’ behavioral intentions
towards the use of ChatGPT in various ways, therefore implying that the use of
ChatGPT ought to be guided by several individualizing principles. However, the
ethical consequences focus on the fact that although the ChatGPT can enhance
creativity and outcome achievement, it compromises integrity and critical thinking. They called for the proper use of AI with defined policies and making sure
the faculties are trained (Malik et al., 2024). Some negative aspects of AI in relation to cheating in academic work were raised by Adeshola and Adepoju (2023),
but a more positive attitude toward the use of AI in enhancing learning was also
observed. Altogether, these works imply that though there are many advantages to
using ChatGPT, it is necessary to establish effective strategies for its integration
into educational systems, provide adequate support for educators, and develop the
ethical code to avoid the undesirable consequences of AI use.
The studies reviewed offer a comprehensive view of how ChatGPT is being
integrated into higher education across different regions and disciplines. According to the studies by Rivadeneira et al. (2024) and Aristovnik (2024), the adoption
and perception of ChatGPT is equally mixed among students and faculty globally
and in Latin American institutions, specifically while the students are optimistic
about the use of the tool to facilitate learning, there is a significant concern about
the cheating that is likely to be facilitated by the tool. Moreover, Amarathunga
(2024) gave a more general bibliometric review and discussed the trends and prospective research avenues, for instance, the lack of worldwide guidelines on AI
application in learning. Altogether, these works support the need for the creation of ethical frameworks for the guidance of AI systems as well as curricular
and policy frameworks that foster the use of systems like ChatGPT in ways that
enrich, rather than reduce, the learning experience.
Various researchers also discussed the academic integrity issues of utilizing
ChatGPT in education, and concerns have been raised about the use of ChatGPT in university education because it may lead to violations of academic integrity (Bhullar et al., 2024). Cotton et al. (2023) explored the use of ChatGPT in
higher education, highlighting its benefits like increased student engagement but
also raising concerns about academic honesty and plagiarism. Authors suggested
strategies that are necessary for using ChatGPT for education, such as ethical use,
including developing policies, providing training, and detecting cheating. Moreover, Perkins (2023) conducted another study to examine the academic integrity
of students using AI tools like ChatGPT in formal assessments. The findings
highlighted the potential of large-language models in teaching digital writing, cocreation between humans and AI, and improving automated writing evaluations.
The study suggested updating academic integrity policies to consider ChatGPT in
future educational environments.

Education and Information Technologies

Several scholars also studied the implications of ChatGPT in the education field.
For example, Farrokhnia et al. (2023) evaluated the implicational potential of ChatGPT in education by conducting a SWOT analysis. The findings indicated that
ChatGPT has strengths such as using a natural language model, self-improvement
capability, and personalized responses. However, it also faces weaknesses like lack
of understanding, evaluation difficulty, bias risk, and cognitive decline. According
to the study, threats include academic integrity threats, plagiarism, and declining
cognitive skills. Fergus et al. (2023) also conducted a study to assess how ChatGPT
could be used in education, specifically using chemistry assessment questions. The
study found that ChatGPT generated responses for knowledge-focused questions but
had limitations for nontext information-based questions. The study concluded that,
despite these limitations, ChatGPT is not considered a high-risk technology tool
pertaining to cheating.
The application of ChatGPT in research has also received significant attention
from scholars. For example, Ivanov and Soliman (2023) and Burger et al. (2023)
explored the latest developments in artificial intelligence relevant to research and
education. Additionally, the perspectives of students and educators on using ChatGPT have been investigated. Shoufan (2023) and Strzelecki (2023) examined students’ views, while Hays et al. (2023) and Strzelecki et al. (2024) focused on educators’ perspectives.
Accordingly, the aforementioned literature indicates that prior studies have
explored the significance of ChatGPT in education from various perspectives. While
concerns have been raised regarding ChatGPT’s integration into educational settings, existing studies emphasize its usefulness as a tool for educators and learners
(Assayed et al., 2022; Han et al., 2023). However, there remains a gap in the literature concerning the use of ChatGPT for self-directed learning, particularly in higher
education.
2.2 Self‑directed learning with technology
Self-directed learning originated within the adult education context (Tough, 1971),
and presently, it is gaining growing significance in the current educational environment since it has been acknowledged as an essential capability for adults and a crucial 21st-century skill (Morris, 2019). Self-directed learning refers to the process
where individuals proactively take charge of their learning needs by independently
identifying and diagnosing their learning needs, seeking out resources for learning,
engaging in the learning process, and subsequently assessing and evaluating their
learning outcomes (Knowles, 1975).
There has been increasing interest in investigating the role of technology and
digital learning tools in facilitating self-directed learning (Wang et al., 2024). The
research studies showed that the utilization of information technology has contributed to enhancing the learners’ self-directed learning (Bartholomew, 2019; Lee
et al., 2017). Prior studies investigated self-directed learning in online educational
settings (Zhu et al., 2022), the role of smartphones and mobile learning apps in
facilitating self-directed learning (Jeon, 2022), and using computer simulations for

Education and Information Technologies

self-directed learning (López‐Úbeda & García‐Vázquez, 2022). The application
of generative AI, including ChatGPT, in the context of self-directed learning, is a
rapidly evolving research area. However, empirical studies on this topic are scarce
(Wang et al., 2024; Lin, 2023).
Recognizing the importance of technology in facilitating self-directed learning,
(Teo et al., 2010) developed the Self-Directed Learning with Technology Scale
(SDLTS). This scale incorporated two factors, such as individuals’ self-management
and their intentional learning using technology to assess their self-directed learning
using technology.
The SDLTS was selected for this study as it is highly appropriate for examining
undergraduates’ acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT for self-directed learning
due to its specific focus on how learners engage with technology to manage their
own learning processes. Given ChatGPT’s role as an AI-driven tool that supports
independent exploration, the SDLTS offers valuable insights into how students leverage it for self-management and intentional learning. Additionally, the SDLTS is
designed with a strong emphasis on technology integration for self-directed learning,
making it particularly relevant for evaluating the role of digital tools like ChatGPT
in self-learning contexts. Furthermore, the SDLTS has been empirically validated
(Teo et al., 2010; Demir & Yurdugül, 2013; Sumuer, 2017), ensuring its reliability
and robustness in assessing students’ engagement with technology for self-directed
learning, making it a suitable instrument for investigating the use of ChatGPT in
self-directed learning.
Considering ChatGPT’s nature as technology and SDLTS’ integration of technology as an element facilitating self-directed learning, SDLTS was deemed the
most appropriate to align with the current research objectives. Thus, SDLTS was
employed to investigate undergraduates’ acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT in
their self-directed learning, along with the UTAUT.
2.3 Theoretical background: The unified theory of acceptance and use
of technology (UTAUT)
The current study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) developed by Venkatesh et al. (2003), which provides the theoretical foundation for this research to examine the acceptance and utilization of
ChatGPT for Self-Directed Learning (SDL) among undergraduates in Sri Lanka.
The UTAUT is developed by integrating various factors from existing technology
acceptance models and it explains the user’s intention to utilize information systems
and ultimately their use behavior.
The UTAUT comprises four fundamental predictors of intention to use information systems. (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and
facilitating conditions) Accordingly, performance expectancy is the extent to which
an individual holds the belief that utilizing the system will facilitate him or her to
attain gains in job performance; effort expectancy involves the extent of ease attributed to operating the system; social influence refers to the extent to which a person believes that the people important to him or her believe he or she should utilize

Education and Information Technologies

the new system; and facilitating conditions refers to the extent to which a person
believes that an organizational and technical infrastructure is in place to facilitate the
use of the systems (Venkatesh et al., 2003).
The UTAUT has been widely employed in research studies across diverse contexts to understand and predict users’ acceptance of new technologies. Some common contexts where UTAUT has been applied include information technology adoption (VanDerSchaaf et al., 2023), e-learning and educational technology (Abbad,
2021), healthcare technology adoption (Ahmed et al., 2020; Strzelecki, 2023),
mobile applications and services (Thomas et al., 2020; Samartha et al., 2022), social
media and online platforms (Al-Rahmi et al., 2022; Puriwat & Tripopsakul, 2021),
e-government services (Zeebaree et al., 2022), e-commerce (Misra et al., 2022), and
emerging technologies (Venkatesh, 2021; Wu et al., 2022).
In the field of education, UTAUT has been utilized to understand and predict how
individuals accept and use ChatGPT (Haglund, 2023; Sallam et al., 2023). Nevertheless, there is a dearth of literature pertinent to the acceptance and use of ChatGPT in relation to self-directed learning in higher education.
UTAUT was selected for this study because it offers a highly effective framework
for explaining students’ acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT for self-directed
learning. UTAUT is a comprehensive model that integrates and extends key aspects
of multiple earlier theories, including the Theory of Reasoned Action, Technology
Acceptance Model, Motivational Model, Theory of Planned Behavior, Combined
Theory of Planned Behavior/Technology Acceptance Model, Model of Personal
Computer Use, Diffusion of Innovations Theory, and Social Cognitive Theory. This
combination makes UTAUT more versatile and insightful than any single model,
especially in complex educational environments. As discussed previously, UTAUT
has been validated across diverse settings and has been demonstrated as an effective tool for analyzing technology adoption across diverse educational contexts. This
empirical validation across various fields further strengthens its applicability, making it a robust framework for understanding the various factors that influence students’ adoption of ChatGPT as a tool for self-directed learning. Therefore, UTAUT
was employed for this study to examine undergraduates’ acceptance and utilization
of ChatGPT in self-directed learning.
2.4 Hypotheses development
According to the UTAUT (Venkatesh et al., 2003), the key factors, such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions,
are examined in this study to investigate the impact of ChatGPT utilization and
adoption on undergraduates’ self-directed learning. Hence, this study tested the following hypotheses.
Performance expectancy, which pertains to individuals’ perceptions of a technology’s effectiveness and usefulness (Venkatesh et al., 2003), is one such aspect
that often emerges as a crucial determinant. In this study, performance expectancy
denotes the degree to which undergraduates perceive ChatGPT as a useful tool for
self-directed learning. According to Menon and Shilpa (2023), when applying the

Education and Information Technologies

UTAUT model to ChatGPT, performance expectancy encompasses individuals’ presumptions on the degree to which using the technology would improve their abilities
to accomplish tasks with greater effectiveness and efficiency. Previous research on
technology adoption has demonstrated that performance expectancy has a substantial predictive ability to reveal behavioral intention (Zhou et al., 2019; Ahmed et al.,
2020).
Moreover, the studies conducted by Almahri et al. (2020), Al-Emran et al.
(2023), and Rahim et al. (2022) affirmed a positive association between students’
performance expectancy and their intention to use chatbots for learning purposes.
According to Foroughi et al. (2023), ChatGPT’s automated generation of appropriate content reduces the search time for learning materials while enhancing reading
and writing abilities. Moreover, authors revealed that students who value its efficacy,
improved performance, and facilitation of easy learning are more inclined to utilize
ChatGPT for education. Their findings also proved that performance expectancy significantly influences the intention to use ChatGPT. Corroborating this, Shahsavar
and Choudhury (2023) revealed that ChatGPT positively impacted users’ intentions
to use the technology in their study examining user inclinations towards using ChatGPT for self-diagnosis and health-related applications.
Within the limited research available, Strzelecki (2023) developed a model that
examined the factors impacting the students’ adoption and utilization of ChatGPT
in higher education. The results revealed that performance expectancy is the second most important predictor of behavioral intention. Moreover, Strzelecki (2023)
asserted that as ChatGPT in higher education remains an evolving area of investigation, subsequent studies could enhance and refine the scale employed in this research
for future research endeavors. Accordingly, it is proposed that:
H1. Performance expectancy has a significant impact on the intention to use
ChatGPT.
As Venkatesh et al. (2003) outlined, effort expectancy is another decisive
factor in the acceptance and utilization of technology, demonstrating the ease
of using the system. Foroughi et al. (2023) contend that students’ effort expectancy indicates their opinion of the ease of using ChatGPT for learning. Despite
the potential advantages of inventiveness, some may believe that using it entails
greater effort than the benefits it offers. As a result, Chatterjee and Bhattacharjee (2020) found that the adoption of new technology is significantly influenced by the efforts of individuals to utilize it. Prior studies have established that
effort expectancy is vital in determining individuals’ intention to use technology (Moorthy et al., 2019; Hooda et al., 2022). According to Huang and Chueh
(2022), when individuals perceive a system as effortless, easy, and user-friendly,
they are more likely to adopt and utilize it. Notably, research by Almahri et al.
(2020) and Al-Emran et al. (2023) revealed a substantial impact of effort expectancy on students’ intention to use chatbots for learning. Specifically, Al-Emran
et al. (2023) discovered that effort expectancy plays a pivotal role in persuading students’ intention to use chatbots for both learning and knowledge sharing.
According to Foroughi et al. (2023), in the context of ChatGPT, learners are not

Education and Information Technologies

required to exert extra effort to grasp its usage, as it resembles the familiar process of searching for information on the Internet. These findings were further
affirmed by Menon and Shilpa (2023), disclosing that effort expectancy predominantly influences the acceptance and usage intention of ChatGPT.
Consequently, when ChatGPT’s usage is simple, transparent, and uncomplicated, this user-friendly experience promotes undergraduates’ intention to utilize
ChatGPT for educational purposes in the future. Within the limited existing studies, Strzelecki’s (2023) exploration of ChatGPT adoption and usage among higher
education students reveals a significant positive influence of effort expectancy on
behavioral intention. Moreover, his study findings indicated that effort expectancy
had the highest mean values in student responses among other variables, demonstrating widespread use of ChatGPT with minimal issues. This implies low effort in
using ChatGPT in higher education, with no impact on behavioral intention. Thus,
prioritizing an understanding of effort expectancy is crucial for individuals aiming
to encourage the adoption and utilization of ChatGPT. Accordingly, it is proposed
that:
H2. Effort expectancy has a significant impact on the intention to use ChatGPT.
The perceived expectations and acceptance of influential people in one’s social
surroundings significantly affect an individual’s intention to accept and use emerging technologies. According to Venkatesh et al. (2003), social influence refers to
the effect of important others’ opinions and attitudes on an individual’s decision to
utilize a new system or technology. This had been affirmed by Leow et al. (2021)
and Hooda et al. (2022), stating that social influence is an integral component that
shapes individuals’ willingness to embrace and make use of new technology. Social
influence in education assesses the effect of an individual’s close social setting,
including peers, instructors, and parents (Foroughi et al., 2023). Numerous prior
study findings confirmed that social influence plays an imperative role in shaping the inclination to utilize chatbots (Melián-González et al., 2021; Terblanche &
Kidd, 2022; Sing et al., 2022; Al-Emran et al., 2023). In light of the study outcomes,
Melián-González et al. (2021) emphasized the importance of taking special consideration for social influence in forthcoming research if the obligatory utilization
of chatbots is introduced in particular scenarios in the future. According to Menon
and Shilpa (2023), the widespread acceptance and increased utilization of ChatGPT
worldwide shortly after its official launch suggest that social influence is considered
a positive factor influencing its adoption. As per Strzelecki (2023), the relevance
of social influence may increase as some universities worldwide formulate policies
on AI tool usage, such as ChatGPT. This suggests that the impact of social factors
could become more significant in shaping the adoption and use of AI tools in educational settings. Therefore, this study assesses the extent to which students are convinced that individuals whose opinions they approve endorse the use of ChatGPT
in their academic pursuits. Drawing from the preceding discourse, the current study
suggests that social influence will significantly contribute to fostering the intention
among undergraduates to utilize ChatGPT for their learning purposes. Accordingly,
it is proposed that:

Education and Information Technologies

H3. Social influence has a significant impact on the intention to use ChatGPT.
As stated by Foroughi et al. (2023), many educators view ChatGPT as a potential
opportunity to revolutionize and advance future learning and research in the education sector, reshaping the way students acquire knowledge and information. According to Rudolph et al. (2023), ChatGPT stands out as the most advanced chatbot to
date, possessing the capability to interact with and comprehend human language
conversationally and generate content based on user input. On the other hand, Firat
(2023) emphasized the significance of studying ChatGPT’s impact on self-directed
learning, as it can uncover best practices for integrating chatbots and AI tools in
education, offering guidance for the future of technology-driven learning and aiding
educators and students in optimizing their use for enhanced independent learning
and development. Self-directed learning pertains to the independent learning process without the guidance or support of a teacher or instructor (Garrison, 1997).
The existence of various AI-based writing tools before the introduction of ChatGPT
emphasizes their role in facilitating self-directed learning, especially in higher education, highlighting the significance of AI tools in students’ self-directed learning
(Rudolph et al., 2023). Accordingly, this study investigates whether the undergraduates’ ChatGPT usage intention influences their self-directed learning behavior. In
this study, behavioral intention refers to the extent to which students plan to accept
and utilize ChatGPT, while use behavior encompasses the frequency of use, seeking additional information, engagement with ChatGPT, improving specific skills,
exploring different perspectives for deeper learning, and actual use of ChatGPT in
self-directed learning. Jayaseelan et al. (2020) contended that behavioral intention
directly influences individuals’ technology utilization. Prior studies, particularly in
education, have also revealed a substantial direct impact of behavioral intention on
use behavior (Leow et al., 2021; Haglund, 2023; Strzelecki, 2023). However, there
is limited research examining the influence of ChatGPT’s behavioral intention on
actual use behavior, specifically in the context of self-directed learning within higher
education. Thus, this underexplored area of study requires more investigations to
understand how ChatGPT’s behavioral intention impacts users’ actions in the fields
of higher education and self-directed learning. Accordingly, it is proposed that:
H4. Behavioral intention has a significant impact on self-directed learning Using
ChatGPT
According to the UTAUT, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social
influence are theorized and empirically supported as critical factors that influence
the behavioral intention to adopt technology, with actual technology utilization
determined by the behavioral intention and facilitating conditions (Venkatesh et al.,
2016). As stated by Venkatesh et al. (2016), facilitating conditions influence both
behavioral intention and the actual utilization of technology. The study findings of
Hunde et al. (2023) demonstrated a clear and direct impact of facilitating conditions
on the utilization of e-learning by health science students. The empirical findings of
Venkatesh et al. (2003) suggested that facilitating conditions demonstrate a direct
influence on usage beyond the explanatory power of behavioral intentions alone.

Education and Information Technologies

This finding aligns with the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior, where facilitating conditions are regarded as a direct antecedent of usage, not fully mediated by intention. Supporting the preceding findings,
Jayaseelan et al. (2020) also revealed a direct association between facilitating conditions and user behavior. According to them, facilitating conditions are the variables
that directly impact system utilization. According to Haglund (2023), more experienced users place higher demands on facilitating conditions due to their reliance on
its usage. Consequently, their behavioral intention is less affected because they can
depend on their experience. This implies that facilitating conditions directly influence the ultimate use behavior, especially for users with more experience. Moreover, the author recommended a more in-depth investigation to uncover the influence
of facilitating conditions on ChatGPT in academic settings, given the ambiguity
observed in the findings of his study.
ChatGPT, according to Firat (2023), has the potential to be a significant asset
for open education by enhancing self-directed learning and developing adaptation
among self-taught students while also upholding efficiency and flexibility. Through
personalized guidance, mentorship, and assessment, ChatGPT has the potential to
boost motivation and engagement in self-directed learners, offering access to highquality, affordable, and accessible educational resources (Haglund, 2023). Strzelecki’s (2023) study on ChatGPT adoption in higher education also highlighted
those facilitating conditions, aligning with the UTAUT model, that strongly influences usage behavior. Moreover, it was revealed that students perceive ChatGPT as
user-friendly, available in multiple languages, requiring only prompts for operation,
and operating independently without additional resources. In light of the discoveries
mentioned above, exploring the potential direct impact of facilitating conditions on
the utilization of ChatGPT for the self-directed learning of undergraduates is crucial,
an aspect that has been overlooked in previous research. Thus, the study explores the
direct impact of facilitating conditions on ChatGPT usage for self-directed learning
by undergraduates in state universities. Accordingly, it is proposed that:

3 Methodology
3.1 Research approach, population, and sample
The higher education sector in Sri Lanka is predominantly characterized by state
universities, which form the core of the sector. These universities are supplemented
by several international affiliated universities, offering a diverse range of educational
programs. This research specifically targets internal undergraduates enrolled in Sri
Lanka’s state university system, which comprises 17 universities distributed across
the country, admitting an average of around 43,000 internal students annually in
total. This results in an estimated active internal student population of approximately
175,000 at any given time. Additionally, the university system is robust, featuring

Education and Information Technologies

111 faculties and 729 departments that span a wide array of disciplines in contemporary education, as per the data from the University Grants Commission (2022).
Adopting a post-positivist epistemological stance, the research utilized quantitative data and employed a deductive design. This methodology, characterized by
its explanatory nature, involved developing hypotheses based on existing theories,
which were then empirically tested using the collected data, aligning with post-positivism principles that emphasize systematic observation and empirical testing. The
unit of analysis in the study was individual internal undergraduates enrolled in state
universities. The study’s population encompassed all such internal undergraduates
who had experience using ChatGPT.
3.2 Questionnaire development
The questionnaire encompasses demographic information and questions to assess
the study variables. To operationalize the research constructs, multi-item reflective
indicators were employed, using a 5-point Likert scale from 1 ("strongly disagree")
to 5 ("strongly agree"). The measures for these constructs were initially developed
from existing literature and then tailored to fit the specific requirements of this
research. When modifying the questionnaire items to align with the research needs,
the original items were carefully adjusted to meet the current study’s objectives. The
construct measuring the use of ChatGPT for self-directed learning was based on the
self-directed learning with technology scale by Teo et al. (2010). Other variables
such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social pressure, facilitating conditions, and behavioral intention were developed using the UTAUT by Venkatesh
et al. (2003), integrating similar items from Tiwari et al. (2023) that assessed students’ use of ChatGPT. The development of the questionnaire was supported by
strong theoretical foundations to evaluate and ensure its content and construct validity. For face validity, the questionnaire first underwent a review by academic members. This was followed by practical testing with a group of students to determine
its relevance and user-friendliness, thus establishing its face validity. This two-step
validation process, involving both expert evaluation and practical testing, was implemented to guarantee the questionnaire’s appropriateness and accessibility for the
intended respondents.
3.3 Data collection
Data collection was conducted online using a Google Form, which included initial
filtering questions to identify suitable respondents for the survey. These questions
were: "Are you currently an internal undergraduate student at a Sri Lankan state
university?" and "Have you ever used ChatGPT?" The questionnaire was developed with a reasonable number of questions to prevent respondent fatigue (Podsakoff et al., 2003). The survey link was shared through the academic members of the
respective universities to reach the potential respondents. The data collection process spanned two weeks, during which several reminders and encouragements were
issued intermittently to increase participation. Ultimately, 627 usable responses

Education and Information Technologies

were obtained and utilized for the analysis. Further, the sample distribution fairly
represented the population, as over 600 out of the 627 responses were drawn from
10 prominent universities across the Western, Central, Southern, North Central, and
North Western provinces of Sri Lanka.
3.4 Data analysis
SPSS version 21 was utilized for preliminary analysis, including sample descriptions on frequencies and an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to assess the degree
of common method bias. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling
(PLS-SEM) was conducted using Smart-PLS software version 4.0.9.9 to test the
hypotheses.
The measurement model was examined for reliability and validity by adopting
the prescribed steps for reflective measurement model evaluation of PLS-SEM. The
structural model was assessed by evaluating path coefficients and respective p-values
calculated through the PLS-SEM algorithm along with a bootstrapping procedure as
prescribed in structural model evaluation. Path coefficients for the entire model were
examined, while the coefficient of determination (R2), predictive relevance (Q2),
and effect size (f2) were specifically evaluated for the endogenous variables.

4 Findings of the study
The sample for this study consisted of 627 individuals, where females constituted
71.8% (450) and males 28.2% (177). The respondents were diverse in terms of their
academic year, with the largest groups being 3rd-year students 32.5% (204), 4thyear students 29.8% (187), 2nd-year students 23.6% (148), 1st-year students 12.8%
(80), and 5th-year students 1.3% (8), indicating a broad representation across different stages of their academic journey. The sample distribution further highlights this
diversity, as over 600 of the 627 valid responses were collected from 10 prominent
universities located across main regions in Sri Lanka. This broad coverage assures
that the findings can be generalized, as around 60 respondents were drawn from each
of these major universities, ensuring a well-distributed and representative sample.
In addressing the potential for common method bias (CMB) inherent in selfadministered online surveys, the approach recommended by Podsakoff et al. (2003)
was adopted. The respondents were notified in the invitation text that there were no
’correct’ or ’incorrect’ answers, ensuring participant objectivity. Additionally, Harman’s single-factor test was applied to evaluate CMB. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) conducted on the survey items indicated that the first factor explained only
20.2% of the total variance, significantly below the 50% threshold suggested by Podsakoff et al. (2003), indicating a reduced impact of CMB.
This study utilized Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLSSEM) as the principal analytical technique, utilizing SmartPLS software for data
analysis. Table 1 comprehensively details the questionnaire items designed to measure the primary constructs of research. This table not only enumerates the items but

also provides a descriptive statistical overview, including the mean value and standard deviation for each item. Additionally, Table 1 systematically presents the relevant criteria to test the reliability of each construct. These metrics consist of factor
loadings, Cronbach’s alpha, Rho_A, Average Variance Extracted (AVE), and Composite Reliability (CR), providing a robust evaluation of the internal consistency,
reliability, and construct validity of the measurement model.

4.1 Measurement model evaluation
The assessment of a reflective measurement model in PLS-SEM encompasses several key steps, primarily focused on evaluating reliability and validity. The reliability
of the constructs was determined through Cronbach’s alpha, Rho_A, composite reliability, and factor loadings. According to Table 1, all criteria for these four parameters consistently exceed the threshold value of 0.7, as established by Hair et al.
(2021), indicating robust reliability across the constructs. The convergent validity
was confirmed in the study, as indicated by the Average Variance Extracted (AVE)
values exceeding 0.5 (Table 1). Additionally, discriminant validity was confirmed
through the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio (Table 2) and the Fornell-Larcker
criterion (Table 3).
The HTMT ratios for all construct combinations were found to be less than 0.9.
Moreover, the diagonal values in the Fornell-Larcker criterion were higher than

Education and Information Technologies

their respective off-diagonal values, thereby validating the discriminant validity of
the construct measures in the measurement model, as outlined by Hair et al. (2021).
4.2 Structural model evaluation and hypotheses testing
Figure 1 presents the structural and measurement model generated by SmartPLS,
depicting both the structural relationships and the measures of the constructs. After
assessing the measurement model, the structural model evaluation was performed,
applying various criteria to determine their thresholds and levels of sufficiency.
The ­R2 values (Fig. 1) of 0.427 for ’behavioral intention’ and 0.494 for ’use of
ChatGPT for self-directed learning’ indicate a moderate explanatory power for
their respective exogenous constructs, aligning with the thresholds outlined by Chin
(1998) and further supported by Hair et al. (2013). The higher ­R2 value for the latter suggests a more robust explanatory model. Furthermore, the ­Q2 values for the
endogenous variables ’behavioral intention’ and ’use of ChatGPT for self-directed
learning’ are 0.417 and 0.315, respectively. These values indicate substantial predictive relevance, as they are greater than zero, in line with the criteria suggested by
Hair et al. (2021).
In Table 4, the path coefficients for each hypothesis are presented. The significance of these coefficients, with the notable exception of ­H2, is established by the
p-values obtained through a comprehensive 10,000-sample bootstrapping procedure
using SmartPLS. Among these paths, the one linking ’behavioral intention’ to ’use
of ChatGPT for self-directed learning’ exhibits the highest value (β = 0.600). Additionally, the other two paths (β = 0.385 and β = 0.374) with significant coefficients
also demonstrate considerable predictive power for their respective endogenous variables. Finally, analyzing the effect sizes (­ f2 values), H
­ 1 and ­H5 show small effects at

5 Discussion
The investigation into ChatGPT’s role in self-directed learning among undergraduates uncovers insights with profound theoretical and managerial implications.
Descriptive statistics show a broad consensus among respondents on the relevance
of selected factors in analyzing ChatGPT’s use in self-directed learning. The analysis
notably highlights marked variances in the ratings of different variables. Variables
like performance expectancy (4.24), effort expectancy (4.12), and facilitating conditions (4.08) receive comparatively higher ratings. In contrast, social influence (3.51),
behavioral intention (3.57), and the actual use of ChatGPT for self-directed learning
(3.87) generate lower, yet substantial, ratings. This pattern suggests that undergraduates in Sri Lanka rate the usability factors and facilities of ChatGPT highly, yet their
intention to use it is not as strong. Interestingly, the actual use of ChatGPT for selfdirected learning is higher compared to their initial usage intention, indicating that
while initial intentions may be moderate, actual usage increases with self-learning
needs. This finding aligns with research indicating a growing dependence among
students on technology-based tools for self-directed learning (Rascón-Hernán et al.,
2019).
The robustness of the multivariate analysis substantiates the effectiveness of the
UTAUT in evaluating self-directed learning via ChatGPT. The measurement models
corroborate the suitability and precision of the metrics used (Venkatesh et al., 2003;
Timothy et al., 2010; Tiwari et al., 2023;). The structural model unveils intriguing
insights regarding the application of ChatGPT, particularly in self-directed learning.

Education and Information Technologies

Notably, the first endogenous variable, behavioral intention to use ChatGPT, exhibits moderate explanatory power influenced by its exogenous variables: performance
expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence. While performance expectancy
and social influence have a significant impact on the intention to use, effort expectancy shows an insignificant association. This finding highlights that undergraduates are inclined to continue using ChatGPT due to its anticipated performance and
social endorsement, aligning with UTAUT’s initial propositions, as reflected in subsequent studies (Rudolph et al., 2023; Foroughi et al., 2023).
Accordingly, the study findings confirmed that performance expectancy significantly influences the intention to use ChatGPT for self-directed learning, aligning
with the UTAUT framework, which identifies it as a key determinant of behavioral
intention (Venkatesh et al., 2003). Existing literature consistently supports this relationship, showing that individuals are more likely to adopt technologies they perceive as enhancing task performance (Zhou et al., 2019; Ahmed et al., 2020). In the
case of ChatGPT, studies by Almahri et al. (2020) and Al-Emran et al. (2023) indicated that students’ perceptions of its usefulness directly influence their adoption.
Foroughi et al. (2023) further emphasized its role in improving learning efficiency,
while Shahsavar and Choudhury (2023) and Strzelecki (2023) confirmed performance expectancy as a central factor in shaping behavioral intention toward using
ChatGPT in educational contexts.
Moreover, social influence, which includes the opinions of peers, educators, and
family members, is another vital factor in technology adoption within educational
contexts (Leow et al., 2021; Hooda et al., 2022). Research has consistently shown
that social factors drive behavioral intention toward AI tools like ChatGPT, as students often seek validation from their social networks when adopting new technologies (Melián-González et al., 2021; Terblanche & Kidd, 2022; Al-Emran et al.,
2023). The swift global acceptance of ChatGPT underscores the positive impact
of social influence on its usage (Menon & Shilpa, 2023). Furthermore, Strzelecki
(2023) posits that as universities implement formal policies regarding AI tools, the
importance of social influence in shaping students’ intentions to adopt ChatGPT
is likely to increase. These findings collectively reinforce the assertion that social
influence is a significant predictor of behavioral intention in educational technology
adoption.
In contrast, while the hypothesis theorizing that effort expectancy significantly
impacts the intention to use ChatGPT was initially supported by the literature, the
results reveal it to be rejected. Venkatesh et al. (2003) emphasized effort expectancy
as a critical determinant of technology acceptance, with studies indicating that students perceive effort expectancy as essential for using ChatGPT (Foroughi et al.,
2023; Almahri et al., 2020). However, recent findings suggest that this factor is less
significant among younger generations (Lajuni et al., 2022; Lakhal & Khechine,
2021; Zhang et al. 2023), particularly undergraduates, who are generally adept at
using technology and may prioritize performance expectancy instead (Lajuni et al.,
2022).
Accordingly, In the context of ChatGPT’s acceptance, the traditionally significant
factor of effort expectancy is observed to be less essential among younger generations, particularly undergraduates. This suggests two conclusions. Firstly, younger

Education and Information Technologies

students may not prioritize ease of use, as they are adept with technology and can
easily adapt to technology-based applications. Secondly, ChatGPT’s user-friendly
design might lead users to overlook the effort needed to use it. This indicates that
the effort needed to use a system is no longer a dominant concern for this demographic, which can be attributed to their inherent technological adaptability from
an early age, leading to less concern about the ease of use of technological systems.
Recent studies support this observation. Lajuni et al. (2022) revealed that performance expectancy is more influential than effort expectancy in financial technology acceptance for Millennials, and Gen Z. Lakhal and Khechine (2021) noted that
effort expectancy’s impact varies across demographics in online course persistence.
In contrast, Zhang et al. (2023) discovered that effort expectancy is significant for
older adults, highlighting a generational divide in technology acceptance. These
findings collectively suggest a generational shift in the factors influencing technology acceptance, particularly with a reduced emphasis on effort expectancy among
younger users.
Additionally, the study findings indicated that behavioral intention significantly
impacts self-directed learning through ChatGPT. Foroughi et al. (2023) highlighted
ChatGPT’s potential to transform education by enhancing knowledge acquisition,
while Rudolph et al. (2023) emphasize its advanced capabilities in generating relevant content. Garrison (1997) defined self-directed learning as an independent
process, which aligns with the facilitative role of AI tools in education. Research
consistently shows that a strong behavioral intention to use technology correlates
with increased engagement in self-directed learning activities, such as seeking information and skill enhancement (Jayaseelan et al., 2020; Leow et al., 2021; Haglund,
2023; Strzelecki, 2023). Additionally, studies by Almahri et al. (2020) and Huang
and Chueh (2022) reinforce that positive behavioral intentions towards educational
technologies can enhance learning outcomes. Therefore, this research underscores
the importance of examining the impact of behavioral intention on the actual use of
ChatGPT to facilitate self-directed learning in higher education.
The utilization of ChatGPT for self-directed learning is identified as a significant endogenous variable, demonstrating considerable explanatory power in terms
of technology adoption. This prominence is notably greater when compared to the
intention to use ChatGPT alone. Such a trend aligns with the foundational elements
of the UTAUT. According to UTAUT principles, use intention and facilitating conditions are pivotal determinants of technology adoption (Alowayr & Al-Azawei,
2021). In the specific context of ChatGPT for educational purposes, it is observed
that the intention to utilize the tool carries more weight than the facilitating conditions. This suggests that the initial intent to engage with ChatGPT is a more crucial
factor in determining user engagement for self-directed learning, underscoring the
importance of intrinsic motivation in the adoption process. The findings are consistent with research on mobile learning and self-directed learning, where intrinsic
motivation and intent to use technology are crucial drivers, often surpassing external
factors like facilitating conditions (Kankok et al., 2020). This trend indicates a shift
in the factors influencing technology acceptance, particularly highlighting a reduced
emphasis on effort expectancy among younger users.

6 Theoretical and practical implications
The theoretical implications of this study could contribute to a broader comprehension of the factors influencing the acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT in
the context of self-directed learning. Thereby, researchers, educators, and policymakers could use these valuable insights to enhance the integration of ChatGPT into self-directed learning environments. Moreover, the study insights lay a
solid foundation for future researchers to widen their study scopes while contributing to current discussions on the ethical and effecrive utilization of ChatGPT
in educational settings. The findings imply that constructs such as performance
expectancy and social influence, previously applied to generalize technology
adoption, could be adapted to better comprehend the acceptance and utilization of
AI-based applications such as ChatGPT in educational settings. Moreover, technology adoption theories require facilitating conditions as an integral component
for effective implementation, recognizing the relationship between intention and
practical concerns necessary for optimal technology utilization.
The educators should emphasize ChatGPT’s perceived benefits in enhancing
academic performance, acquiring knowledge, and developing skills, promoting
its application in self-directed learning, while programmers should consider the
self-directed learning requirements for further improvement and development of
the application. Moreover, community engagement could be improved through
collaborative usage and positive experience sharing. The student’s awareness of
and familiarity with technology could be increased while encouraging ChatGPT
adoption through focused training, educational campaigns, and curricular integration strategies. The educational institutions could invest in infrastructure development, training programs, and continuous support systems to offer a conducive
environment for students to incorporate ChatGPT into their self-directed learning.
Countries such as China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore are already
incorporating AI-focused curricula in schools and promoting the incorporation
of AI elements in teacher education programs (UNESCO, 2023). It also emphasized the need for guidance on the effective and ethical use of these tools. For
example, the Australian Computer Society (ACS) in Australia develops standards
and guidelines for the ethical use of technology, including AI. Linking digital
competency frameworks with ACS standards assures that educational programs
impart technical skills, ethical reasoning, and problem-solving abilities necessary
for navigating AI-driven changes (Sandu et al., 2024).

7 Conclusion and future scope
The current study examined the acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT for selfdirected learning among undergraduates, utilizing the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the Self-Directed Learning with
Technology Scale (SDLTS). The results indicate that performance expectancy

Education and Information Technologies

and social influence significantly impact undergraduates’ behavioral intention to
use ChatGPT. Effort expectancy, however, did not show a significant impact on
behavioral intention. Moreover, behavioral intention to use ChatGPT and facilitating conditions were shown to have a significant influence on the actual use
of ChatGPT for self-directed learning among undergraduates. These findings
emphasize the importance of perceived usefulness, the influence of social factors, and facilitating conditions in driving the acceptance and use of ChatGPT in
educational settings. While this study provides valuable insights into the factors
influencing the acceptance and use of ChatGPT for self-directed learning among
undergraduates, there are several avenues for further investigation. This study
employed a quantitative approach to investigate the acceptance and utilization of
ChatGPT for self-directed learning among undergraduates.
In the near future, it is planned to integrate qualitative methods, which could provide comprehensive insights into students’ experiences and perceptions regarding
ChatGPT in self-directed learning. While this study examined the undergraduates’
perspective, future research could also look into educators’ perceptions towards the
use of ChatGPT to promote self-directed learning. Exploring how educators interpret and use ChatGPT in their teaching practices may provide a more comprehensive understanding of its role in education. Moreover, the research could further
explore ChatGPT’s impact on undergraduates’ self-directed learning across diverse
academic disciplines, long-term educational outcomes, and comparisons with traditional learning approaches. Additionally, the ethical considerations and privacy concerns pertinent to the use of ChatGPT in educational contexts could be explored in
order to develop guidelines for responsible implementation.
