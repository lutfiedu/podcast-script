Abstract
Integrating ChatGPT into educational contexts has become prevalent due to its potential to revolutionize teaching, learning, and research. However, to ensure positive use, it is necessary to design learning environments that effectively incorporate
this technology. This study employed self-determination theory as an undergirding framework to understand the impact of ChatGPT-integrated instruction on undergraduate students’ research skills. Moreover, the study explored the impact of
ChatGPT-integrated instruction on students’ autonomous motivation, engagement,
and self-directed learning, as well as the mediating role of these variables in the
relationship between ChatGPT usage and research skills. In this quasi-experimental
study, 366 undergraduate students majoring in education were divided into control
and experimental groups. The control group received instruction without ChatGPT,
while the experimental group received ChatGPT-integrated instruction and was allowed to use ChatGPT for research-related activities. The results revealed that the
experimental group had significantly higher levels of research skills, motivation,
engagement, and self-directed learning behavior. Moreover, the use of ChatGPT
has a significant indirect impact on students’ research skills through the mediating
variables. This suggests that high autonomous motivation and self-directed learning
are crucial for students to fully benefit from ChatGPT in developing research skills.
The findings offer valuable insights for educators to design AI-enhanced learning
environments to enhance students’ research skills and learning outcomes.

1 Introduction
The landscape of education is undergoing a revolutionary transformation driven by
the relentless progress of technology, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI) (BaidooAnu & Ansah, 2023). Artificial intelligence has found its way into the heart of education, reshaping teaching methodologies (Karsenti, 2019; Rudolph et al., 2023) and
learning environments (Karsenti, 2019) and improving learning outcomes (Khan et
al., 2021; Kim, 2021). At the forefront of this revolution are the chatbots, sophisticated AI-driven tools designed to assist and engage learners by providing personalized learning experiences, immediate feedback, and innovative and interactive
instructional designs (Adıgüzel et al., 2023; Assor et al., 2009; Atlas, 2023; Kasneci et al., 2023; Xiao & Zhi, 2023). One such remarkable AI chatbot is ChatGPT
(released on November 30, 2022), a large language generation model that has not
only revolutionized the world of natural language processing but also has emerged as
a potential game-changer in education (Chukwuere, 2023; Zhai, 2023).
ChatGPT has seamlessly integrated into various facets of education with its ability
to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. It has also opened new avenues for AI-enhanced teaching, learning, assessment, and evaluation (Baidoo-Anu
& Ansah, 2023; Deng & Lin, 2022; Rudolph et al., 2023). As we delve into the role
of ChatGPT, we find a tool that extends beyond conventional boundaries, providing
students with more than just information; it fosters a dynamic, interactive, motivating, and individualized learning environment (Adıgüzel et al., 2023; Atlas, 2023;
Kasneci et al., 2023; Muñoz et al., 2023; Su & Yang, 2023). ChatGPT is a versatile
platform and has diverse applications in education and research, i.e., language learning (Kasneci et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2022), personalized learning (Adıgüzel et al.,
2023), group and remote learning, facilitation for disabled learners (Kasneci et al.,
2023), immediate feedback (Halaweh, 2023; Kasneci et al., 2023), review and evaluation of written content, essay and research writing, and idea generation for essay
and research (Atlas, 2023; Rahman & Watanobe, 2023). Moreover, its applications
in writing, translation, paraphrasing, grammar improvement, and idea generation
(Atlas, 2023; Kasneci et al., 2023; Xiao & Zhi, 2023) make it an effective tool for
developing students’ skills in academic writing (Dowling & Lucey, 2023).
ChatGPT has transformative potential in the field of research and academic inquiry
(Atlas, 2023). The emergence of ChatGPT has redefined how students engage with
their research process. ChatGPT can play the role of research assistant (Dowling &
Lucey, 2023), as it can be used at all stages of the research process, such as developing research ideas and maturing the research problem, literature review, selecting
suitable methodology, data analysis, discussion, and creating the outline and writing
the final draft of the research paper (Atlas, 2023; Fiialka et al., 2023; Halaweh, 2023;
Karakose et al., 2023; Kasneci et al., 2023; Rahman & Watanobe, 2023). However,
despite its promising potential to assist in research, its efficacy depends on how students interact with it because it is a tool that, when used optimally, can empower
learners (Yang et al., 2022), but if misused, may lead to dependency and hinder the
development of essential skills (Kasneci et al., 2023).
Kasneci et al. (2023) stated that learners may heavily rely on ChatGPT because
it generates information quickly without much effort. Consequently, students may

13

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

4187

over-rely on ChatGPT, causing an impediment in their creativity, critical thinking,
and problem-solving skills (Mhlanga, 2023; Shiri, 2023). Moreover, students may
use ChatGPT to cheat, complete assignments, and write research papers without testifying to the information generated by ChatGPT (Zhai, 2022); thus, it would limit
their competence in research activities. Dai et al. (2023) suggested that students
should have a set of competencies to get quality responses from ChatGPT, so teachers
must provide guidance and training to students for effective use of ChatGPT. Moreover, some students may still misuse ChatGPT even under the instructor’s guidance
(Yu, 2023); therefore, teachers must create an engaging and motivating environment
where students can control their learning process, improving their competency and
learning outcomes (Zhou & Li, 2023).
The body of research on the use of ChatGPT is growing. Still, little empirical
evidence has been provided to prove that integrating ChatGPT into research teaching would improve students’ research skills. Moreover, little literature is available to
understand the phenomenon behind research skills development by utilizing ChatGPT as a supportive tool. The present quasi-experimental study employed self-determination theory (SDT) as the theoretical framework to reveal the effects of ChatGPT
usage in creating an autonomous learning environment, thereby affecting engagement and self-directed learning behavior during research methodology class and how
ChatGPT influences students’ research skills through these variables.

2 Literature review
2.1 Previous chatbots applications in education
Over the last few years, artificial intelligence in education has seen rapid growth
(Roos, 2018). One of the prominent applications being used is chatbot systems
(Okonkwo & Ade-Ibijola, 2020). Chatbots are conversational agents that provide
instant responses to users and have been recognized for their potential to enhance
teaching and learning (Clarizia et al., 2018; Smutny & Schreiberova, 2020). Chatbots
enhance and promote an engaging and personalized learning environment (Cunningham-Nelson et al., 2019). They deliver students with standardized information such
as course details (Cunningham-Nelson et al., 2019), learning materials, assessment
criteria (Benotti et al., 2017), question-answer exercises (Ranoliya et al., 2017; Sinha
et al., 2020), assignment due dates and timelines for assignment completion, and
guidance (Ismail & Ade-Ibijola, 2019). They not only promote student engagement
but also reduce the academic and administrative burden on lecturers; thus, lecturers can focus more on curriculum design and research (Cunningham-Nelson et al.,
2019). Further applications of chatbot systems in education have been illustrated in
several studies. For example, chatbots have been used to answer students’ queries
(Clarizia et al., 2018; Sinha et al., 2020), aid in understanding and learning computer programming (Okonkwo & Ade-Ibijola, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020), assessment
of student performance (Durall & Kapros, 2020), task completion and engagement
(Benotti et al., 2017), and administrative services (Hien et al., 2018).

ChatGPT is a new form of chatbot that can generate and maintain a human-like
conversational style. It has been trained on terabytes of data using natural language
processing algorithms so that it can generate relevant content upon the user’s request
(Open AI). Unlike other chatbots, ChatGPT can sustain a coherent and engaging dialogue style, offering contextually appropriate responses to each question. ChatGPT
has shown great performance in many application domains, such as content and essay
generation, language translation, question answering, programming and coding, and
writing improvement (Kasneci et al., 2023). In the context of education, it provides
many benefits to educators, such as lesson and course planning, designing specific
topic-related lectures and problem sets, etc. ChatGPT can assist students in language
learning, problem-solving, task completion, writing essays, and explaining topics to
enhance learning (Deng & Lin, 2022). ChatGPT’s applications in different domains
have made it imperative for researchers to study its role in advancing teaching, learning, and research. Hence, this study explores the students’ use of ChatGPT and its
effect on their research skills.
2.2 Theoretical framework: Self-determination theory (SDT)
Self-determination theory, a widely recognized psychological theory developed by
(Deci & Ryan, 1985; Ryan & Deci, 2000), explores the motivation behind human
behavior and posits that individuals have innate psychological needs that drive them
to be self-determined in their actions. These needs are autonomy (the need for individuals to feel control over their actions and choices), competency (the desire for
individuals to feel effectiveness and mastery in their endeavors), and relatedness (the
need to feel connected to others and develop meaningful relations within the context
of one’s pursuits) (Ryan & Deci, 2000). According to Deci and Ryan (1985), when
these psychological needs of individuals are satisfied, they appear to be intrinsically
motivated, self-determined, autonomous, and self-directed in their actions. In the context of education, STD assumes that when students’ psychological needs are satisfied,
they are more motivated and engaged in their learning process (Assor et al., 2009;
Ryan & Deci, 2000). Within the context of this framework, the study turns its focus
to autonomy, a central component of STD. It explores how autonomy, when fostered
through ChatGPT usage under instructor guidance, influences students’ autonomous
motivation, engagement, and self-directed learning and impacts students’ research
competence in the realm of higher education.
Autonomy, in the context of education, pertains to the students’ inherent need for
control, choice, and volition in their actions and decision-making in their learning
process (Ryan & Deci, 2020). Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots and
ChatGPT into education is intrinsically tied to the principle of autonomy. As AIdriven tools, chatbots allow students to engage with them and make choices and decisions, taking control of their learning experiences and promoting learners’ autonomy
(Chen et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2022). ChatGPT is a recent AI-driven chatbot that has
revolutionized the teaching-learning process as it has numerous applications such as
the provision of immediate feedback, personalized learning experiences, language
learning, structural and content suggestions for essays (Xiao & Zhi, 2023), and uses
in academic and research writing (Fiialka et al., 2023).

13

4189

ChatGPT promotes an autonomous study environment by allowing students to
develop their learning objectives, goals, and content under the supervision of teachers (Adıgüzel et al., 2023; Muñoz et al., 2023). ChatGPT can analyze students’ performance and suggest learning pathways and content-specific learning resources
(Kasneci et al., 2023; Wang & Chen, 2023). As in the traditional mode of learning,
students do not need to ask their teachers about small details every time they face
a particular problem in their academic journey because ChatGPT provides instant
suggestions (Wang & Chen, 2023). Thus, when teachers integrate ChatGPT into the
instructional process, it promotes autonomous, independent, and self-directed learning among students (Dai et al., 2023; Fiialka et al., 2023; Xiao & Zhi, 2023) because,
in technology-driven instructional design, students actively engage in the learning
process through interaction, experimentation, and experience (Sutton & Allen, 2019).
Moreover, the findings from the study of Muñoz et al. (2023) suggest that integrating ChatGPT into the teaching process increases student motivation to learn autonomously. Hence, it can be concluded that ChatGPT integration in teaching fosters
autonomy among students, resulting in active engagement and autonomous motivation and promoting self-directed learning (Assor et al., 2009; Ryan & Deci, 2000).
Based on the above discussion, the research model is grounded in self-determination theory (SDT). It suggests that the use of ChatGPT under the instructor’s guidance fosters an autonomous learning environment. The use of ChatGPT promotes
active engagement and autonomous motivation; as a result, students develop the necessary skills to conduct research independently. By focusing on autonomous motivation, this framework offers a lens to explore the motivational processes in educational
contexts and their role in developing research skills among undergraduate students.
2.3 Hypothesis development
Motivation and engagement are crucial factors influencing student achievement and
learning outcomes (Deci et al., 1991; Rafiola et al., 2020). As defined by Deci and
Ryan (1985), motivation encompasses internal and external factors that drive students to pursue specific learning goals. In contrast, engagement refers to the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral depth of students’ involvement in learning activities
(Fredricks et al., 2004). More narrowly, engagement can be defined as ‘time and
effort’ spent performing educational activities (Radloff & Coates, 2010). Higher levels of student motivation and engagement are integral to fostering an environment
where students actively participate and invest in their learning (Lo et al., 2022). Consequently, contemporary literature strongly emphasizes various factors to enhance
motivation and engagement, particularly emphasizing instruction design. Literature
suggests that instructional design that prioritizes personalized learning experiences,
immediate feedback, and autonomous and active learning environments positively
impacts students’ motivation and engagement in learning (Adıgüzel et al., 2023;
Cunningham-Nelson et al., 2019).
The advent of technology has shaped the landscape of teaching-learning methods;
thus, technology-enhanced and especially AI-driven instructional designs emerge as
key contributors to building motivational and engaging learning environments (Gikas
& Grant, 2013; Hirankerd & Kittisunthonphisarn, 2020; Xiao & Zhi, 2023). The use

13

4190

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

of AI-driven tools, including chatbots such as ChatGPT, in teaching and learning has
gained attention for their potential to transform instructional approaches. Chatbots
and large language models, particularly ChatGPT have vast applications in education such as the provision of instant feedback, autonomy-based learning (Yang et
al., 2022), personalized learning recommendations (Chen et al., 2022), assistance in
academic and research writing (Kasneci et al., 2023), language learning (Xiao & Zhi,
2023), and critical and deep-thinking cultivation (Wang & Chen, 2023). Integrating
these chatbots in teaching fosters interactive learning experiences, thus improving
students’ motivation and engagement (Adıgüzel et al., 2023).
Muñoz et al. (2023) found that using ChatGPT during English language learning
significantly affected students’ intrinsic motivation and engagement and developed a
sense of independence and empowerment. Integrating ChatGPT into instruction and
allowing students to use this tool positively facilitates autonomous learning abilities, flexible interaction, student communication, and student learning outcomes and,
consequently, improves students’ motivation and engagement (Adıgüzel et al., 2023;
Muñoz et al., 2023; Wang & Chen, 2023). In addition, findings suggest that ChatGPT enhances student motivation and active engagement as it assists in developing personalized learning goals (Atlas, 2023; Su & Yang, 2023), allows intelligent
dialogue (Zhou & Li, 2023), increases interest, and deep thinking, and knowledge
absorption (Wang & Chen, 2023), and promotes collaborative learning (Kasneci et
al., 2023). ChatGPT considers the students’ individuality and cultivates an autonomy-based learning atmosphere where students actively engage in their learning
activities (Wang & Chen, 2023; Xiao & Zhi, 2023). Furthermore, past research posits
that ChatGPT usage increases students’ motivation and engagement with research
because it gives instant feedback, reviews and evaluates written content, improves
grammar, and helps in idea generation, locating the resources of information, and
data analysis (Atlas, 2023; Dowling & Lucey, 2023; Halaweh, 2023; Muñoz et al.,
2023). Therefore, it can be proposed that.
H1a ChatGPT usage positively affects students’ motivation.
H1b ChatGPT usage positively affects student engagement.
Self-directed learning (SDL) is “a process in which individuals take the initiative,
with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs; formulating
learning goals; identifying material and human resources for learning; choosing and
implementing appropriate learning strategies; and evaluating learning outcomes”
(Knowles, 1975). Self-directed learners engage in challenging tasks and develop personal knowledge and abilities to solve these tasks efficiently (Gibbons, 2002). Selfdirected learning (SDL) is synonymously used with autonomous learning in which
students have the locus of control and responsibility for their learning activities without people’s assistance, such as teachers, parents, peers, etc. (Oddi, 1987; Pierson,
1996; Svedberg, 2010) hence SDL directly aligns with the autonomy principle of
self-determination theory (SDT). According to SDT, when the autonomy needs of
students are satisfied, they become intrinsically motivated and engaged to take charge
of what, when, and how to learn (Chan, 2001; Ryan & Deci, 2020). SDL has been

13

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

4191

found to enhance academic achievement (Cazan & Schiopca, 2014) and students’
learning outcomes (Zhoc et al., 2018); thus, researchers focus on factors such as
motivation, engagement, and technology to foster SDL behavior among students.
Research has shown that enhanced student engagement and motivation catalyze
students toward self-directed learning (Altinpulluk et al., 2023; Rashid & Asghar,
2016). The level of motivation and engagement in digital learning environments predict what, when, and how learners learn (Barak et al., 2016; Deimann & Bastiaens,
2010). Altinpulluk et al. (2023) found a moderate positive correlation between intrinsic motivation and self-directed learning among students in Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs). Similarly, (Rashid & Asghar, 2016) conducted a study to find the
interrelations between technology use, student engagement, self-directed learning,
and academic performance. They found that technology use has a positive impact on
student engagement, which in turn improved students’ self-directed learning.
Technology and AI-based learning environments also play a crucial role in fostering self-directed learning by developing motivation and engagement (Baidoo-Anu &
Ansah, 2023; Firat, 2023; Rashid & Asghar, 2016; Sumuer, 2018). Technology-based
learning environments increase student autonomy and allow students to take control
of their learning (Chiu et al., 2023b; Gikas & Grant, 2013), promoting self-directed
learning. With the advent of AI in education, researchers have shifted their focus to
AI chatbots and how these enhance student motivation, engagement, self-directed
learning, and learning outcomes. AI chatbots provide individualized guidance and
learning paths, instant feedback, and enable students to recognize, learn from, and
improve their mistakes, thus prompting self-reflection and self-directed learning
(Chiu et al., 2023b; Xia et al., 2022). ChatGPT, one of the recent AI chatbots, can
encourage self-directed learning by providing asynchronous and autodidact learning
opportunities, increased involvement and communication, and individualized education (Adıgüzel et al., 2023; Firat, 2023). Thus, students using AI chatbots responsibly are more motivated and engaged in learning activities. Firat (2023) suggested
five ways ChatGPT can promote self-directed learning among students: personalized support, real-time feedback and guidance, increased accessibility, convenient
and flexible learning, and enhancing the use of open educational resources. Incorporating ChatGPT into educational programs heightens students’ motivation to study
independently (Muñoz et al., 2023) and develops a greater sense of volition in their
learning process (Dai et al., 2023; Fiialka et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). However,
not all students can utilize ChatGPT to its maximum potential because the responses
of ChatGPT mainly depend on how effectively a person can prompt it to get the
desired response; thus, teachers should train students to write effective prompts (Dai
et al., 2023). Xiao and Zhi (2023) recommended that teachers guide students using
ChatGPT to take charge of their learning and become autonomous and self-directed
learners. Hence, ChatGPT usage under instructor guidance would increase students’
motivation and engagement in the learning process, resulting in more self-directed
learning behavior. Therefore, it can be deduced that:
H2a Students’ motivation positively influences self-directed learning.
H2b Student engagement positively influences self-directed learning.

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

Research is an inquiry-based process that includes research design, methodology,
data collection and analysis, and communicating the findings through report writing (Kothari, 2004). Students’ ability to plan and conduct research is influenced by
a blend of motivational, gnoseological, operational, and personal factors (Prosekov
et al., 2020), and central to these is self-directed learning. Prosekov et al. (2020)
reported that students with a strong intrinsic motivation for educational activities,
characterized by self-directed learning and self-affirmation, are more adept at developing their knowledge and research skills (Prosekov et al., 2020). Self-directed learning, in particular, has been linked to positive academic outcomes (Zhoc et al., 2018),
such as higher GPAs and successful college entrance examinations, as evidenced in
the Hong Kong context (Zhoc & Chen, 2016). Moreover, self-directed learning activities promote students’ confidence, cognitive abilities, intrinsic motivation to acquire
new knowledge, high understanding of information, critical thinking, and reasoning
abilities (Jennings, 2007; Lounsbury et al., 2009; Lunyk-Child et al., 2001; Smedley,
2007). Self-directed learning has also been found to affect students’ research competencies as when students can independently choose the resources of knowledge,
formulate research problems and hypotheses, analyze data, and draw conclusions,
they possess high research skills (Prosekov et al., 2020). Therefore, the study proposes that,
H3 Students’ self-directed learning is positively related to research skills.
Research skills depend not merely on motivational factors but also on gnoseological and operational factors, i.e., the ability to initiate a research problem, plan and
organize research, knowledge of research apparatus, and report the findings to others
(Prosekov et al., 2020). Creswell (2015) provided six steps for conducting research:
identifying the research problem, reviewing the literature, specifying the research
purpose, collecting the data, analyzing and interpreting data, and reporting and evaluating the research. The emergence of artificial intelligence and ChatGPT has facilitated students’ proficient mastery of these steps, and a reasonable amount of research
has been conducted on the uses of AI and ChatGPT in scientific research (Dowling
& Lucey, 2023; Gao et al., 2022; Grimaldi & Ehrler, 2023; Hutson, 2022; Alshater,
2022; Zhai, 2022). ChatGPT has been found to affect the performance of students
and researchers at all stages of research, i.e., idea generation (Atlas, 2023; Dowling
& Lucey, 2023; Halaweh, 2023; Kasneci et al., 2023), literature reviews (Dowling
& Lucey, 2023; Halaweh, 2023), data collection (Fiialka et al., 2023), data analysis
(Atlas, 2023; Halaweh, 2023; Karakose et al., 2023; Kasneci et al., 2023; Van Dis
et al., 2023), and writing summary reports (Mhlanga, 2023; Rahman & Watanobe,
2023). ChatGPT can assist students in locating the sources of information, summarization of research articles, hypothesis development, writing outlines for articles
and theses, writing initial drafts, providing feedback, and evaluating written content
(Atlas, 2023; Halaweh, 2023; Karakose et al., 2023; Kasneci et al., 2023; Rahman
& Watanobe, 2023). Critical evaluation and data feedback given by ChatGPT on
written content can help improve vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure, thus
improving students’ writing capabilities (Rahman & Watanobe, 2023). Moreover, its
uses for translation, paraphrasing, summarization, and qualitative and quantitative

13

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

4193

data analysis are also commendable (Fiialka et al., 2023; Mhlanga, 2023; Xiao &
Zhi, 2023). However, ChatGPT’s benefits during the research process rely mainly on
the individuals using it because the quality of ChatGPT’s responses depends on the
quality of the prompts; thus, instructors should guide students to give better prompts
to ChatGPT (Dai et al., 2023). Therefore, it can be concluded that ChatGPT, if used
effectively, will enhance students’ research potential by assisting at every stage of the
research process (Dowling & Lucey, 2023). Therefore,
H4 ChatGPT usage positively affects students’ research skills.
Based on the above-given literature, the current study proposes a mediation model, as
shown in Fig. 1, where ChatGPT usage indirectly influences students’ research skills
by increasing their autonomous motivation, engagement, and self-directed learning
behavior.
Allowing students to use ChatGPT under the instructor’s guidance enhances
their intrinsic motivation through personalized learning experiences and autonomysupported learning environments (Adıgüzel et al., 2023; Muñoz et al., 2023). Students receive instant feedback, recommendations, and learning paths tailored to their
needs, capabilities, and interests, fostering a sense of ownership and control over
their learning activities. This is related to the autonomy principle of self-determination theory (STD) and explains the role of ChatGPT in satisfying students’ autonomy
needs and boosting their intrinsic motivation (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Ryan & Deci,
2000). Moreover, ChatGPT provides interactive learning dialogues (Zhou & Li,
2023) and enhances student communication (Kasneci et al., 2023), increasing student engagement (Adıgüzel et al., 2023). This interactive learning environment keeps
students actively involved in the learning process, fostering greater understanding

Fig. 1 Conceptual framework

13

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

and critical thinking (Wang & Chen, 2023), ultimately leading to greater motivation
and engagement. Enhanced motivation and engagement directly contribute to the
development of self-directed learning (SDL). When students feel they have control
over their learning, they are more likely to take initiative, set goals, and manage
their learning independently (Ryan & Deci, 2020). Furthermore, higher engagement
in learning activities increases active participation and exploration, promoting selfdirected learning behaviors like research problem-solving and discovery learning
(Altinpulluk et al., 2023; Rashid & Asghar, 2016). ChatGPT makes complex tasks
look easy, and as students experience success and progress in their learning, they
become more confident in their abilities to take challenging tasks and complete them
independently, which is essential for becoming self-directed learners.
SDL has a direct relationship with improved research competency and skills.
Students who engage in self-directed learning activities develop crucial research
skills like problem identification, hypothesis generation, data collection, analysis,
and drawing conclusions (Prosekov et al., 2020). These skills are the cornerstone
of research competency and enable students to conduct independent research projects effectively. Furthermore, SDL promotes critical thinking and reasoning abilities
(Jennings, 2007; Smedley, 2007), enhancing students’ capacity to analyze information, interpret findings, and draw sound conclusions – invaluable skills for conducting quality research. Additionally, the confidence and initiative gained through SDL
empower students to take ownership of their research projects, leading to enhanced
research skills (Prosekov et al., 2020). Thus, it can be concluded that ChatGPT usage
under the instructor’s guidance can indirectly but significantly improve students’
research skills through its influence on motivation, engagement, and self-directed
learning. Therefore:
H5 Autonomous motivation, engagement, and self-directed learning mediate the
relationship between ChatGPT usage and research skills.

3 Methods
3.1 Research design
The study employed a quasi-experimental design with two distinct groups, i.e., the
experimental group (with intervention) and the control group (without intervention).
This aligns with the suggestion (Anderson-Cook, 2005) that a quasi-experimental
design is appropriate when the random assignment of groups is impractical. This
study was conducted in a large public sector university in Pakistan. It focused on
final-year undergraduate students in the Department of Education who were enrolled
in the ‘Research Methodologies’ course and were working on their final-year project
or thesis. Since the target population’s characteristics were unique, final-year students enrolled in a research methodology course, working on the final thesis; thus,
employing a true experimental design posed challenges. Considering the scarcity
of resources, random assignment of participants to groups was impractical. The
researcher accessed all the classes formed by the university’s Department of Edu-

13

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

4195

cation. After seeking permission from the head of the department, the researcher
randomly assigned three classes to each of the experimental and control groups to
enhance the experiment’s internal validity.
3.2 Participants and procedure
The study included 366 undergraduate students in their final year enrolled in the
Bachelor of Arts in Education majors at a large public sector university in Pakistan.
The experimental and control groups comprised 206 and 160 students, respectively.
There were six classes, and three classes for each group were selected randomly. The
course content for both groups comprised six steps of conducting research: Identifying the research problem, reviewing the literature, specifying the research purpose,
collecting the data, analyzing and interpreting data, and reporting and evaluating the
research (Creswell, 2015). The course duration for six classes was ten weeks, with
three lectures per week, each one hour long. Students were required to pass a written exam and write a research proposal at the end of the semester to evaluate their
research skills. Students who participated in the current study had similar educational
backgrounds. Moreover, instructors in both were middle-aged males with comparable years of work experience. It should also be noted that instructors in control and
experiment groups taught the students in the same way, except for the difference in
ChatGPT usage.
3.3 Instructional design
3.3.1 Control group
The control group received traditional teaching to cover the course contents. Conventional teaching methods were used, such as lectures, discussions, assigned books, and
article readings. Teachers used PowerPoint presentations to explain the basic concepts about each step of conducting research and assigned different classroom activities and homework assignments for practice. To enhance the experiment’s validity,
teachers in control groups prohibited students from using ChatGPT and informed
them about AI writing detection tools to check their written content. This strategy
ensured that students in this group would not use ChatGPT to complete the given
assignments.
3.3.2 Experimental group
In the experimental group, the course content was augmented through the integration of ChatGPT during teaching. The version of the ChatGPT that instructors and
students used was 3.5. The instructors demonstrated the features of ChatGPT and
its uses for performing different tasks, such as writing, feedback, and locating the
sources of information. The instructor taught the research steps and the uses of ChatGPT at each step. The rationale behind the instructor’s guidance on ChatGPT usage
was to develop digital competencies among students in using AI-driven tools.

3.3.2.1 Students’ training on the use of ChatGPT The training involved guiding students on how to use and interact with ChatGPT to facilitate learning tasks. Instructors
covered four main aspects of training: (1) features of ChatGPT, (2) uses of ChatGPT
in research, (3) constructing effective prompts, and (4) applications of ChatGPT for
research-related activities. The training sessions were integrated into the regular lectures. At the end of every lecture, teachers demonstrated the uses of ChatGPT to
master the taught content, and students applied ChatGPT to various learning and
research activities.
Before the practical training, instructors discussed the ethical issues and potential drawbacks of using ChatGPT. Ethical principles were integrated throughout the
whole course, emphasizing the responsible use of ChatGPT, avoiding plagiarism,
and verifying the information provided by ChatGPT. Students were informed about
false citations, references, and information provided by ChatGPT and were instructed
to verify these from Google Scholar or other databases. An important part of the
training involved constructing effective prompts. The training sessions were interactive and hands-on. Initially, instructors explained the key components of an effective
prompt: task, context, and exemplar. Students practiced these components through
practical exercises. Subsequent training involved using ChatGPT in actual research
tasks. Table 1 describes students’ training on ChatGPT usage at each research step
and some sample prompts that they used during the practice.
Several mechanisms were adopted to ensure students used ChatGPT ethically and
effectively. First, teachers observed students during the practice sessions and also
provided individual guidance on writing prompts. It also helped the instructors evaluate the students for proficiency in ChatGPT usage. Second, instructors verified the
accuracy of the information and citations given in students’ reports, and the presence of false citations indicated that students did not verify them during the research.
Third, AI detection tools were used to detect if students had copy-pasted the contents from ChatGPT. Moreover, the attainment of expected training outcomes was
evaluated through classroom observations and demonstrations. Students were asked
to present their prompts in front of the class, expressing their understanding of the
applications of ChatGPT in research tasks.
3.3.2.2 Students’ interaction with ChatGPT Screenshots of students’ logs were taken
to demonstrate how they interacted with ChatGPT. These logs provide insights into
the quality of prompts and responses given by ChatGPT to facilitate students’ research
activities. Examples of a few prompts and ChatGPT’s responses are provided below.
The quality of ChatGPT’s response depends on the quality of the prompts it is
given. Figure 2 is an example of a student discussing research ideas with ChatGPT.
From the first part of the picture, it is evident that the question was not clear; hence,
ChatGPT did not provide a specific response. The 2nd part shows the student’s clarification of the question and the ChatGPT’s improved and specific response. It can
also be used to generate outlines for literature reviews (Fig. 2) and discuss suitable
research methodologies for any research topic (Fig. 3). Similarly, it can also be used
to search data collection instruments (Fig. 4).

ChatGPT also offers assistance in understanding data analysis techniques based
on the research questions. Figure 5 illustrates a student’s query to identify an appropriate test for their research question. As shown in the figure, ChatGPT provides a
comprehensive response to guide students. By asking follow-up questions, students
can refine their inquiries specific to their research interests. For instance, the student
in Fig. 5 could ask, “How do we conduct regression analysis in SPSS, and how do
we interpret results?” and ChatGPT would generate step-by-step instructions for carrying out the analysis as well as interpretations of the obtained results. Therefore,
using clear and specific prompts with ChatGPT leads to more precise and helpful
responses.

3.4 Instruments and data collection
Items to measure the constructs in the current study were taken from published
sources. Four items from the use behavior construct of the UTAUT model (Venkatesh
et al., 2003) were used to measure students’ use of ChatGPT. The items were modified in the context of ChatGPT usage. The following are samples of the items used
to measure ChatGPT usage in the study: “I communicate with ChatGPT when I face
problems during research-related tasks” and “I use ChatGPT to discuss my research
ideas and problem identification”. To assess the students’ autonomous motivations to
learn and conduct research, the intrinsic motivation scale from the Academic Motivation Scale (Venkatesh et al., 2003) was employed, and items were modified in
the context of this study. The scale consisted of five items that explored students’
autonomous motivations to learn and conduct research. Some of the items of the
autonomous motivation scale are as follows: “I experience pleasure and satisfaction
while doing research”, “For the pleasure I experience when I discover new things

13

4200

in research that I have never learned before”, and “Because research allows me to
continue to explore many ideas that interest me”.
The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale for Students, validated by Carmona-Halty et
al. (2019), was utilized to measure students’ engagement. The scale originally measured workers’ engagement with work, but four items taken from this were modified in the context of the study to capture students’ engagement with research. Some
of the items on the engagement scale are “I feel energetic and capable when I’m
learning research” and “I am enthusiastic about my research”. To measure students’ self-directed learning, Lounsbury et al. (2009)’s self-directed learning scale
was employed and administered to measure students’ perceptions of self-directed
behavior in doing research. A few items of the SDL scale were “I am very good at
finding out answers on my own for research-related tasks” and “I am good at finding
the right resources to help me do well in research”. Lastly, to examine the level of
research skills of students, Alfakih (2017)’s scale was employed to measure students’
skills in developing research proposals. This scale comprised six items that measured
students’ perceptions of research skills. The modified six items measured students’

13

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

4201

Fig. 5 Using ChatGPT for assistance in data analysis

skills in problem identification, writing literature reviews and research methodology,
identifying data analysis techniques, and report writing. Some of the items were “I
am able to identify a general research area of interest and select a research topic”,
“I can locate different information sources to find literature that is associated with
the general research area”, and “I can explain data analysis approaches necessary
for my research topic”.
All items in the questionnaire survey were measured on a five-point Likert scale
ranging from “strongly disagree (1)” to “strongly agree (5)”. A confirmatory factor
analysis was conducted to ensure the reliability and validity of the research instruments. Each scale’s composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE)
were calculated to ensure validity and convergent validity. Furthermore, discriminant
validity analysis was also conducted to ensure the validity of the modified instru-

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

ments. The details of the validity and reliability analysis are provided in the results
section.
The survey form was administered to both groups before the first lecture of the
course to collect pre-test data. The survey form for the pre-test did not include the
ChatGPT usage and student engagement scale. The pre-test data was collected to
ensure that the control and experimental groups did not differ significantly in terms
of autonomous motivation, self-directed learning, and research skills. The survey
form was again introduced at the end of the semester to collect post-test data from
the control group. However, since the experimental group was using ChatGPT, the
ChatGPT usage scale was added to the post-test data collection. Moreover, students’
engagement with the course and research-related activities was also measured for
both groups in the post-test.
3.5 Sample size for SEM
The sample size in this study was 366, of which 160 students were in the control
group, and 206 students were in the experiment group. The post-test collected from
the experimental group was used in SEM analysis. The sample size for SEM is
adequate based on the following thresholds. Kline (2023) argues that SEM models
require a minimum sample size of 200. Hair et al. (2010) suggested that the sample
size for SEM could be 200, and an acceptable sample size for SEM could be 100
(Bagozzi, 2010).
3.6 Data analysis
Data analysis was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, SPSS version 26 was
employed for descriptive statistics to determine the levels and differences in the study
variables between pre and post-test and control and experimental groups. Skewness
and kurtosis were used to test the univariate normality of data, and the values indicated that the data were normally distributed. Means and standard deviations were
calculated to find the level of autonomous motivation, self-directed learning, and
research skills of students before the start of the experiment. An Independent sample
t-test was used to confirm that the control and experimental groups did not differ
significantly in terms of different variables. After post-test data collection, an Independent sample t-test was used to locate the difference in the study variables and
understand the effects of the experiment. After it was confirmed that the control and
experimental groups differed significantly in terms of study variables at the end of
the course, the researcher moved to 2nd stage of data analysis. In the second step,
the post-test data from the experimental group was used to examine the structural
relationships between the study variables and explore the phenomenon behind the
increased autonomous motivation, engagement, and research competency due to
ChatGPT integration in instructional design.
Two-step structural equation modeling (SEM) (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988) using
Mplus 8.3 as analysis software was applied in this stage to evaluate SEM assumptions, the proposed model fit, validity, and reliability. The two-step SEM includes

testing the measurement model (CFA) followed by testing the hypothesized relationships between latent variables.

4 Results
4.1 Stage 1: Descriptive statistics
The skewness and kurtosis values were checked for all variables in the questionnaires in pre-test and post-test data to ensure the normality of data and the values
were found to be in the normal range of ǀ3ǀ and ǀ8ǀ, respectively (Kline, 2023). In the
pre-test, t-test statistics did not reveal any significant differences in the mean scores
of autonomous motivation, self-directed learning, and research skills. However, posttest data showed significant differences in the mean scores of all variables. The t-test
results of the post-test are given in Table (2).
4.2 Stage 2: Structural equation modeling
4.2.1 Checking SEM assumptions
Before assessing the measurement model, the data was examined for SEM assumptions, including missing values, outliers, linearity, multicollinearity, and multivariate normality. The data contained no missing values. Outliers were identified using
Cook’s distance, with cases having values over 1 considered potential outliers (Weisberg & Cook, 1982). In the current dataset, no cases exceeded a value of 0.5, indicating the absence of significant multivariate outliers. A curve estimation procedure
was employed to test the linearity assumption. The results showed that the highest
F values were obtained for linear relationships, thereby confirming the linearity in
relationships. Multicollinearity was assessed using variance inflation factors (VIF),
tolerance impact values, and a multivariate correlation matrix. According to Hair et
al. (2010), VIF values less than 3 and tolerance values greater than 0.1 indicate that
multicollinearity is not present. The regression collinearity diagnostics revealed that
VIF values for all independent variables were less than 2 with tolerance exceeding
0.1. Similarly, Hair et al. (2010) remarked that multicollinearity exists if the correlaTable 2 Comparison of means scores of different variables among control and experimental groups

tion between independent variables is 0.9 or greater. As shown in Table 3, correlations between all independent variables were below 0.9, which further confirms the
absence of multicollinearity. To assume multivariate normality, kurtosis, and its critical ratio were evaluated using Mardia’s normalized estimate of multivariate kurtosis.
The results showed a critical ratio value of 3.482, which is below the threshold of 5
(Bentler & Wu, 2005), indicating that multivariate normality can be assumed. Following the SEM assumptions, data was used for further SEM analysis.
4.2.2 Measurement model
In the assessment of the measurement model, the fit between observed and latent
variables and sample data was analyzed. The measurement model was tested using
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to check the validity and reliability of the items
explaining the endogenous variables. The goodness of fit of the model was evaluated
against several criteria like X2/df, CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and SRMR. A measurement
model is considered to have an acceptable fit if X2/df < 3, CFI > 0.90, TLI > 0.90,
RMSEA < 0.08, and SRMR < 0.08 (Hair et al., 2010; Kline, 2023). Based on these
criteria, the measurement model of the present study received an acceptable fit
(X2 = 426.305, df = 242, X2/df = 1.762, CFI = 0.916, TLI = 0.904, RMSEA = 0.061,
SRMR = 0.059). Moreover, the study also calculated average variance extracted
(AVE) and composite reliability (CR) for convergent validity and reliability of all
constructs. The recommended limits for AVE and CR are 0.5 (Fornell & Larcker,

4.2.4 Hypothesis testing
Among the six proposed direct relationships, four were supported (Table 5). ChatGPT usage had a significant positive effect on students’ autonomous motivation
(β = 0.551, p < .01) to attend the research methodologies class and participate in
assigned research-related activities. Similarly, it also had a significant positive effect
on student engagement (β = 0.506, p < .01) with the class and research activities.
Autonomous motivation had a significant positive effect (β = 0.481, p < .01) on selfdirected learning; however, student engagement did not have a significant effect on it.
Similarly, self-directed learning had a significant positive effect on the research skills
of students (β = 0.553, p < .01); however, the direct effect of ChatGPT use on research
skills was nonsignificant.
In indirect pathways, the proposed hypotheses were supported by the results
(Table 6). The influence of ChatGPT through all mediators, i.e., autonomous motivation, engagement, and SDL, is significant (β = 0.190, p < .01), thus supporting the 5th
hypothesis. Overall, the conceptual model significantly explains the indirect effect
of ChatGPT usage under instructor guidance on students’ research skills (β = 0.223,
p < .01).

5 Discussion
The advent of ChatGPT has raised some concerns among educators and university
teachers. A key question instructors face is whether to allow students to use ChatGPT
for coursework. While concerns exist regarding academic integrity, ChatGPT also
holds the potential to enhance teaching and learning (Kohnke et al., 2023; Sullivan
et al., 2023). This study aimed to address these concerns by providing a framework
for effective ChatGPT integration in instruction and encouraging responsible student
use. Drawing upon the self-determination theory, the study developed a conceptual
model to investigate how ChatGPT usage enhances research skills through the medi-

13

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

4207

ating role of autonomous motivation, student engagement, and self-directed learning.
The study’s results supported the model, emphasizing the pivotal role of autonomous
motivation, student engagement, and self-directed learning between AI-enhanced
learning environments and students’ research skills development. These findings contribute significantly to the current understanding of the intricate phenomenon behind
improved learning outcomes in technology-enhanced classrooms and the positive
adoption of AI tools in teaching and research.
5.1 Impact of ChatGPT on autonomous motivation and student engagement
The study confirms the positive and significant impact of ChatGPT on students’
autonomous motivation and engagement in the classroom. This finding is affirmed
by the post-experiment results, where students in the ChatGPT augmented group
exhibited greater motivation and engagement than those taught traditionally. This
finding aligns with several recent studies (Adıgüzel et al., 2023; Atlas, 2023; Chiu et
al., 2023a; Muñoz et al., 2023; Wang & Chen, 2023). One potential explanation for
this is ChatGPT’s ability to expedite learning by providing swift solutions to challenging tasks, also highlighted by Crawford et al. (2023). Unlike traditional methods
that involve searching various platforms, i.e., Google, Bing, etc. ChatGPT can generate copious topic-specific data efficiently. This efficiency of ChatGPT keeps students
engaged and motivated in independent research. Secondly, ChatGPT fulfills students’
performance expectancy needs (Strzelecki, 2023). It stimulates them to capitalize
on the time for handling significant academic challenges, ultimately enhancing their
motivation and research productivity. As highlighted by Gamage et al. (2023), students view ChatGPT as a supportive academic tool, particularly when confronted
with demanding coursework and assignments. ChatGPT usage fuels students’ motivation and keeps them engaged in research by acting as a supportive tool to tackle
challenging tasks.
Finally, ChatGPT facilitates enhanced motivation and engagement by addressing
students’ autonomous needs. It fosters student autonomy by facilitating personalized learning paths, self-directed learning objectives, and problem-solving through
interaction and communication (Adıgüzel et al., 2023; Kasneci et al., 2023). Moreover, Chiu et al. (2023a) posit that students experience a greater sense of connection,
freedom, and choice when learning with chatbots. It fulfills their autonomy need,
which is essential in promoting autonomous motivation and engagement (Ryan &
Deci, 2000). Muñoz et al. (2023) further accentuate the role of ChatGPT in developing motivation and engagement by establishing an autonomous learning environment with flexible interaction. Its ability to provide feedback and suggestions on
student-created research models retains students’ motivation to further engage in the
research activities. Students perceived ChatGPT as a technology-enhanced tool and
were actively involved with it to explore its capabilities and techniques to help them
write an effective research proposal.
In conclusion, the findings of the study support that the effective use of ChatGPT
can demonstrably enhance student engagement with learning content, fostering a sustained motivation to learn. Furthermore, the findings suggest that autonomy-oriented
learning environments are more interactive, and ChatGPT is a helpful tool to satisfy

13

4208

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

autonomy needs. Instructors should allow students to play with ChatGPT and provide
proper guidance on its uses to direct students toward autonomous learning.
5.2 Role of self-directed learning (SDL)
The present study indicated that students in the experimental group reported higher
self-directed learning levels (SDL). Moreover, SEM analysis revealed that autonomous motivation has a direct, positive, and significant relationship with SDL. As for
the effect of engagement on SDL, the study found a nonsignificant effect of engagement on SDL, contrasting with previous studies (Altinpulluk et al., 2023; Rashid &
Asghar, 2016) that reported a significant relationship between student engagement
and SDL. The possible explanation could be that students can be engaged in both technology-enhanced and non-technology-enhanced classrooms with minimal emphasis
on SDL because SDL is the students’ volition over their learning (what, when, and
how to learn); thus, higher engagement with learning may not necessarily indicate
higher SDL. The study’s findings affirm that engagement is not a significant predictor
of SDL among students; rather, students must have strong autonomous motivation for
independent learning. The primacy of autonomous motivation in ChatGPT-integrated
and technology-enhanced learning environments is also highlighted by Chiu et al.,
2023a); Xia et al. (2022). Autonomically motivated students have a more substantial
need for autonomy, independence, and control of learning, leading to self-directed
learning behaviors. Thus, autonomous motivation is central in encouraging students
to adopt self-learning as they engage in learning activities. Moreover, the study also
suggests that while student engagement does not significantly contribute to SDL, it
might work in conjunction with autonomous motivation to strengthen the relationship between ChatGPT usage and SDL.
The enhanced SDL behavior in the experimental group is important to discuss.
It can be attributed to several aspects of ChatGPT’s functionality and how students
engage with it. First, the instructional design allowed students to take ownership of
their learning while exploring the tool’s features. ChatGPT can promote SDL by
empowering students to determine what, when, and how they learn. Secondly, ChatGPT can cater to individual learning orientations and preferences, cultivating independent learning by suggesting relevant learning resources (Adıgüzel et al., 2023;
Firat, 2023). In the instructional design of this research, students used ChatGPT to
generate ideas, search for content on research topics, solicit feedback on their ideas,
and revise their writing for grammatical structure and coherence. Using ChatGPT
for evaluation and feedback induces self-correction and self-reflection, ultimately
fostering self-directed learning. Thirdly, ChatGPT bridges the gap in classrooms
where individualized guidance on research topics is not possible. In a typical research
methodology class, teachers introduce the foundations of the research methods, but
students are left to apply them independently. ChatGPT integration into the course
filled this gap for the students. As students interacted with ChatGPT individually,
it provided insights into writing styles, research methodologies, data collection
approaches, and data analysis techniques specific to each student’s research topic.
These autonomous learning activities encourage independent work and SDL, with

ChatGPT acting as an “AI proxy teacher” (Chiu et al., 2023a) and enhancing students’ research potential.
The results supported 3rd hypothesis that SDL has a significant positive relationship with students’ research skills. Self-directed learners are more adept at developing
their knowledge and research skills (Prosekov et al., 2020). They have high confidence, critical thinking, understanding of the information, and reasoning abilities
(Jennings, 2007; Lounsbury et al., 2009; Lunyk-Child et al., 2001; Smedley, 2007).
The participants in the current study, with the help of ChatGPT, were able to independently choose research topics, select resources of information, formulate research
questions and hypotheses, select research methodologies, and write different sections
of the research proposal; hence, SDL with ChatGPT assisted students in improving their research skills. The study further solidifies that learning environments that
promote SDL behavior among students provide improved learning outcomes. Hence,
it is suggested that teachers utilize ChatGPT, show its features to students, and
show how it can be used throughout the research process to solve hurdles independently. This independence in solving complex tasks significantly improves students’
research competency, and the findings of this study have confirmed this. However, it
is important to reiterate that ChatGPT is a learning intermediary, not a replacement
for teachers (Chiu et al., 2023b; Kohnke et al., 2023; Xiao & Zhi, 2023). Teachers’
role is essential in providing the basic foundations of research methods. Although
ChatGPT offers valuable support during research, it also provides inaccurate and
logically incoherent responses. A student with prior research knowledge may benefit
more by critically engaging with it. If students detect some wrong information provided by ChatGPT, they can ask the teacher who can correct it for them. The presence of a teacher during the independent learning process by ChatGPT offers a more
in-depth understanding of the content. Hence, the study also highlights the role of a
human teacher during self-directed learning with ChatGPT.
5.3 Impact of ChatGPT on Research skills
The study’s post-experiment results revealed a significant difference in the students’
research skills in the control and experiment groups. Notably, SEM results indicated
that the direct effect of ChatGPT usage on students’ research skills is nonsignificant;
however, the indirect effect mediated by autonomous motivation, student engagement, and self-directed learning was statistically significant. These results provide
insights into the intermediatory role of student motivation, engagement, and selfdirected learning in the relationship between the use of ChatGPT and research skills.
The study findings show that the direct impact of ChatGPT usage on students’
research skills is not significant. A few arguments from existing literature can provide
elaboration on this phenomenon. Previous studies indicate that relying on ChatGPT
can impede students’ development of essential skills like critical thinking (Kasneci
et al., 2023; Mhlanga, 2023; Michel-Villarreal et al., 2023), brainstorming, problem-solving (Kasneci et al., 2023), and research abilities (Shiri, 2023). Students may
become passive recipients of information rather than active participants in the learning process (Michel-Villarreal et al., 2023). Hence, the effectiveness of ChatGPT
depends on how it is integrated into the learning process. Without proper guidance,

13

4210

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

students may not fully utilize the potential of ChatGPT. Therefore, in this study, students were trained to provide effective prompts to ChatGPT and validate the credibility of its responses. This guided instruction stimulated active engagement among
the students when learning with ChatGPT. The findings of the study prove this argument and indicate that allowing students to use ChatGPT enhances their engagement, which is a crucial factor in improving their overall research skills. The current
study also shows that ChatGPT usage enhances students’ autonomous motivation.
Autonomous motivation is an important predictor of students’ self-directed learning
behavior, as evident from the results. A self-directed learner can independently select
reliable resources for learning and critically evaluate the learning contents, hence
possessing greater research skills (Prosekov et al., 2020). Therefore, ChatGPT’s role
is not limited to direct improvements in research skills; rather, it significantly impacts
other key intermediary factors, and through those factors, it affects research skills.
The importance of mediating factors becomes apparent when considering the specific challenges students face in the research process. Rastri et al. (2023) highlight
the challenges undergraduate students face while writing a research proposal, e.g.,
knowledge of the English language, topic selection, critical evaluation of research
articles, literature review, and methodological/data analysis decisions. Although
teachers guide about each problem in the classroom, they cannot provide personalized guidance to every student in topic selection, writing literature, selecting research
methodology, and other important areas of the research process. The study showed
that integrating ChatGPT in instruction allows the students to communicate these
problems with ChatGPT. It provides prompt and relevant information tailored to their
specific interests, mitigating frustration and increasing their engagement and motivation for research. Students interact with ChatGPT to discuss their initial ideas on
a chosen topic and refine them to a well-defined research question. Additionally, it
provides current literature, suitable research methods, and appropriate data analysis
techniques for the particular research topic of interest (Atlas, 2023; Fiialka et al.,
2023; Rahman & Watanobe, 2023). The results of the current study indicate that
ChatGPT cultivates a sense of accomplishment and progress in students by alleviating students from these complex tasks and promoting motivation for independent
research. Thus, ChatGPT assists in advancing students’ research skills by increasing
their engagement with research activities and motivation to learn independently.
Lastly, as discussed in the role of SDL, ChatGPT promotes SDL by allowing students to take control of their learning. The integration of ChatGPT in instruction
reduces helplessness among students (Wu et al., 2024), and they always have an
extra “More Knowledgeable Other” (Stojanov, 2023) to guide their research process.
This study’s findings showed that this is crucial for self-directed learning, where
students utilize the functionalities of ChatGPT to draft learning paths tailored to
their needs and make independent progress in the course and the proposal writing
process. ChatGPT, acting as MKO (Stojanov, 2023) or “AI proxy teacher” (Chiu et
al., 2023b), provides individualized support, real-time feedback, and guidance on
research-related issues, free and uninterrupted accessibility, and convenient and flexible learning, thereby promoting SDL behavior among students. The findings explain
how ChatGPT can assist students in learning autonomously and independently and
promote self-directed learning and learning outcomes (Dai et al., 2023; Fiialka et

13

Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:4185–4216

4211

al., 2023; Firat, 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). Moreover, students, guided by instructors,
develop the necessary competencies to use ChatGPT for research-oriented activities. Integrating ChatGPT into the instructional process makes learning environments
more interactive and engaging and promotes intrinsic motivation and SDL behaviors among students, thus increasing the students’ research skills. The findings of
this study can provide insights into instructional designs with ChatGPT and other AI
technologies.

6 Conclusion
The emergence of ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened
new avenues for AI-enhanced teaching and learning by offering vast applications in
education. Educators are keen on effectively integrating these tools in instructional
designs to enhance students’ learning outcomes. This study, grounded in self-determination theory, investigated the impact of ChatGPT-integrated instruction on autonomous motivation, engagement, self-directed learning, and research skills among
undergraduate students in a “Research Methodology” course. Furthermore, it also
explored the complex role of autonomous motivation, engagement, and self-directed
learning in mediating the relationship between ChatGPT usage and research skills.
The results indicate that integrating ChatGPT into instructional design significantly
improves students’ autonomous motivation, engagement, self-directed learning, and
research skills. The mediating role of autonomous motivation, engagement, and selfdirected learning suggests that learning should be more interactive and motivating,
and students must be empowered to take volition in their learning actions. It will
allow students to leverage ChatGPT effectively and use it to enhance their research
skills. Moreover, the study stresses the need for human tutors to guide the learning
process and develop digital competencies among students who use ChatGPT. The
research provides insights into instructional designs with ChatGPT and other AI technologies and gives valuable information on utilizing the full potential of ChatGPT for
teaching and learning research.

7 Limitations and future research directions
This study has several limitations. Firstly, the participants of the study were from a
single university in Pakistan. Therefore, the generalizability of the results may be
limited. Future studies with larger and more diverse samples are recommended to
validate the results. Secondly, the study relies on questionnaire surveys as a quantitative approach. Future studies should take a more qualitative approach to gain a deeper
understanding of the conceptualized model. Thirdly, the study focused on autonomous motivation and student engagement. However, motivation encompasses various other aspects like extrinsic motivation and amotivation. Including these diverse
motivation factors alongside different engagement dimensions (behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social) in further studies can provide a more nuanced explanation
of how ChatGPT influences student learning.
